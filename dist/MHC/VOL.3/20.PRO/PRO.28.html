     See here, 1. What continual frights those are subject to that go on in wicked ways. Guilt in the conscience makes men a terror to themselves, so that they are ready
     <i>
      to flee when none pursues
     </i>
     ; like one that absconds for debt, who thinks every one he meets a bailiff. Though they pretend to be easy, there are secret fears which haunt them wherever they go, so that they fear where no present or imminent danger is, Ps. 53:5. Those that have made God their enemy, and know it, cannot but see the whole creation at war with them, and therefore can have no true enjoyment of themselves, no confidence, no courage, but a
     <i>
      fearful looking for of judgment
     </i>
     . Sin makes men cowards.

     <i>
      keep conscience void of offence
     </i>
     and so keep themselves in the love of God:
     <i>
      The righteous are bold as a lion
     </i>
     , as a young lion; in the greatest dangers they have a God of almighty power to trust to.
     <i>
      Therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed

     . Whatever difficulties they meet with in the way of their duty, they are not daunted by them.

     Note, 1. National sins bring national disorders and the disturbance of the public repose:
     <i>
      For the transgression of a land
     </i>
     , and a general defection from God and religion to idolatry, profaneness, or immorality,
     <i>
      many are the princes thereof
     </i>
     , many at the same time pretending to the sovereignty and contending for it, by which the people are crumbled into parties and factions, biting and devouring one another, or many successively, in a little time, one cutting off another, as 1 Kgs. 16:8; or soon cut off by the hand of God or of a foreign enemy, as 2 Kgs. 24:5 As the people suffer for the sins of the prince,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     Delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi-- Kings play the madmen, and their people suffer for it, so the government sometimes suffers for the sins of the people. 2. Wisdom will prevent or redress these grievances:
     <i>
      By a man
     </i>
     , that is, by a people,
     <i>
      of understanding
     </i>
     , that come again to themselves and their right mind, things are kept in a good order, or, if disturbed, brought back to the old channel again. Or, By a prince of
     <i>
      understanding and knowledge
     </i>
     , a privy-counsellor, or minister of state, that will restrain or suppress
     <i>
      the transgression of the land
     </i>
     , and take the right methods of healing the state thereof, the good estate of it will be prolonged. We cannot imagine what a great deal of service one wise man may do to a nation in a critical juncture.

    <p>
     See here, 1. How hard-hearted poor people frequently are to one another, not only not doing such good offices as they might do one to another, but imposing upon and over-reaching one another. Those who know by experience the miseries of poverty should be compassionate to those who suffer the like, but they are inexcusably barbarous if they be injurious to them. 2. How imperious and griping those commonly are who, being indigent and necessitous, get into power. If a prince prefer a poor man, he forgets that ever he was poor, and none shall be so oppressive to the poor as he, nor squeeze them so cruelly. The hungry leech and the dry sponge suck most.
     <i>
      Set a beggar on horseback, and he will ride
     </i>
     without mercy. He
     <i>
      is like a sweeping rain
     </i>
     , which washes away the corn in the ground, and lays and beats out that which has grown, so that it
     <i>
      leaves no food
     </i>
     . Princes therefore ought not to put those into places of trust who are poor, and in debt, and behind-hand in the world, nor any who make it their main business to enrich themselves.

     Note, 1. Those that
     <i>
      praise the wicked
     </i>
     make it to appear that they do themselves
     <i>
      forsake the law
     </i>
     , and go contrary to it, for that curses and condemns the wicked. Wicked people will speak well of one another, and so strengthen one another’s hands in their wicked ways, hoping thereby to silence the clamours of their own consciences and to serve the interests of the devil’s kingdom, which is not done by any thing so effectually as by keeping vice in reputation. 2. Those that do indeed make conscience of the law of God themselves will, in their places, vigorously oppose sin, and bear their testimony against it, and do what they can to shame and suppress it. They will reprove the works of darkness, and silence the excuses which are made for those works, and do what they can to bring gross offenders to punishment, that others may hear and fear.

    <p>
     Note, I. As the prevalency of men’s lusts is owing to the darkness of their understandings, so the darkness of their understandings is very much owing to the dominion of their lusts:
     <i>
      Men understand not judgment
     </i>
     , discern not between truth and falsehood, right and wrong; they understand not the law of God as the rule either of their duty or of their doom; and, 1.
     <i>
      Therefore
     </i>
     it is that they are
     <i>
      evil men
     </i>
     ; their wickedness is the effect of their ignorance and error, Eph. 4:18. 2.
     <i>
      Therefore
     </i>
     they
     <i>
      understand not judgment
     </i>
     , because they are
     <i>
      evil men
     </i>
     ; their corruptions blind their eyes, and fill them with prejudices, and because they do evil they
     <i>
      hate the light
     </i>
     . It is just with God also to
     <i>
      give them up to strong delusions
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     II. As men’s
     <i>
      seeking the Lord
     </i>
     is a good sign that they do understand much, so it is a good means of their understanding more, even of their understanding all things needful for them. Those that set God’s glory before them as their end, his favour as their felicity, and his word as their rule, and apply to him upon all occasions by prayer,
     <i>
      they seek the Lord
     </i>
     , and he will give them the spirit of wisdom. If a man
     <i>
      do his will

     , he shall
     <i>
      know his doctrine
     </i>
     , John 7:17.

      A good understanding those have

     Here, 1. It is supposed that a man may
     <i>
      walk in his uprightness
     </i>
     and yet be poor in this world, which is a temptation to dishonesty, and yet may resist the temptation and continue to
     <i>
      walk in his uprightness
     </i>
     —also that a man may be
     <i>
      perverse in his ways
     </i>
     , injurious to God and man, and yet be rich, and prosper in the world, for a while, may be rich, and so lie under great obligations and have great opportunities to do good, and yet be
     <i>
      perverse in his ways
     </i>
     and do a great deal of hurt. 2. It is maintained as a paradox to a blind world that an honest, godly, poor man, is better than a wicked, ungodly, rich man, has a better character, is in a better condition, has more comfort in himself, is a greater blessing to the world, and is worthy of much more honour and respect. It is not only certain that his case will be better at death, but it is better in life. When Aristides was by a rich man upbraided with his poverty he answered,
     <i>
      Thy riches do thee more hurt than my poverty does me

    <p>
     Note, 1. Religion is true wisdom, and it makes men wise in every relation. He that conscientiously
     <i>
      keeps the law
     </i>
     is wise, and he will be particularly
     <i>
      a wise son
     </i>
     , that is, will act discreetly towards his parents, for the law of God teaches him to do so. 2. Bad company is a great hindrance to religion. Those that are
     <i>
      companions of riotous men
     </i>
     , that choose such for their companions and delight in their conversation, will certainly be drawn from
     <i>
      keeping the law of God
     </i>
     and drawn to transgress it, Ps. 119:115. 3. Wickedness is not only a reproach to the sinner himself, but to all that are akin to him. He that keeps rakish company, and spends his time and money with them, not only grieves his parents, but shames them; it turns to their disrepute, as if they had not done their duty to him. They are ashamed that a child of theirs should be scandalous and abusive to their neighbours.

    <p>
     Note, 1. That which is ill-got, though it may increase much, will not last long. A man may perhaps raise a great estate, in a little time, by usury and extortion, fraud, and oppression of the poor, but it will not continue; he gathers it for himself, but it shall prove to have been gathered for somebody else that he has no kindness for. His estate shall go to decay, and another man’s shall be raised out of the ruins of it. 2. Sometimes God in his providence so orders it that that which one got unjustly another uses charitably; it is strangely turned into the hands of one
     <i>
      that will pity the poor
     </i>
     and do good with it, and so cut off the entail of the curse which he brought upon it who got it by deceit and violence. Thus the same Providence that punishes the cruel, and disables them to do any more hurt, rewards the merciful, and enables them to do so much the more good.
     <i>
      To him that has the ten pounds give the pound
     </i>
     which the wicked servant
     <i>
      hid in the napkin

   <div class="article">
    <p>
     Note, 1. It is by the word and prayer that our communion with God is kept up. God speaks to us by his law, and expects we should hear him and heed him;
     <i>
      we
     </i>
     speak to him by prayer, to which we wait for an answer of peace. How reverent and serious should we be, whenever we are hearing from and speaking to the Lord of glory! 2. If God’s word be not regarded by us, our prayers shall not only not be accepted of God, but they shall be an abomination to him, not only our sacrifices, which were ceremonial appointments, but even our prayers, which are moral duties, and which, when they are put up by the upright, are so much his delight.

     Note, 1. Those that are rich are apt to think themselves wise, because, whatever else they are ignorant of, they know how to get and save; and those that are purse-proud expect that all they say should be regarded as an oracle and a law, and that none should dare to contradict them, but every sheaf bow to theirs; this humour is fed by flatterers, who, because (like Jezebel’s prophets) they are fed at their table, cry up their wisdom. 2. Those that are poor often prove themselves wiser than they: A

     . Most people think that those are happy who never fear; but there is a fear which is so far from having torment in it that it has in it the greatest satisfaction. Happy is the man who always keeps up in his mind a holy awe and reverence of God, his glory, goodness, and government, who is always afraid of offending God and incurring his displeasure, who keeps conscience tender and has a dread of the appearance of evil, who is always jealous of himself, distrustful of his own sufficiency, and lives in expectation of troubles and changes, so that, whenever they come, they are no surprise to him. He who keeps up such a fear as this will live a life of faith and watchfulness, and therefore happy is he, blessed and holy. 2. The danger of a sinful presumption:
     <i>
      He that hardens his heart
     </i>
     , that mocks at fear, and sets God and his judgments at defiance, and receives not the impressions of his word or rod,
     <i>
      shall fall into mischief
     </i>
     ; his presumption will be his ruin, and whatever sin (which is the greatest mischief) he falls into it is owing to the hardness of his heart.

     Two things are here intimated to be the causes of the mal-administration of princes:—1. The love of money, that

      root of all evil

     ; for
     <i>
      hating covetousness

     <i>

     , according to Moses’s character of good magistrates,
     <i>
      men fearing God and hating covetousness
     </i>
     (Exod. 18:21), not only not being covetous, but hating it, and shaking the hands from the holding of bribes. A ruler that is covetous will neither do justly nor love mercy, but the people under him shall be bought and sold. 2. Want of consideration:
     <i>
      He that hates covetousness shall prolong
     </i>
     his government and peace, shall be happy in the affections of his people and the blessing of his God. It is as much the interest as the duty of princes to reign in righteousness. Oppressors therefore and tyrants are the greatest fools in the world; they
     <i>
      want understanding
     </i>
     ; they do not consult their own honour, ease, and safety, but sacrifice all to their ambition of an absolute and arbitrary power. They might be much happier in the hearts of their subjects than in their necks or estates.

The duty of the avenger of blood, whether the magistrate or the next of kin, or whoever are concerned in making inquisition for blood, let them be close and vigorous in the prosecution, and let it not be bought off. Those that acquit the murderer, or do any thing to help him off, come in sharers in the guilt of blood; nor can the land be purged from blood but by the blood of him that shed it, Num. 35:33.

Integrity and uprightness will preserve men, will give them a holy security in the worst of times; for it will preserve their comfort, their reputation, and all their interests. They may be injured, but they cannot be hurt. 2. Those that are false and dishonest are never safe:

     Note, 1. It is a fundamental error in the administration of justice, and that which cannot but lead men to abundance of transgression, to consider the parties concerned more than the merits of the cause, so as to favour one because he is a gentleman, a scholar, my countryman, my old acquaintance, has formerly done me a kindness, or may do me one, or is of my party and persuasion, and to bear hard on the other party because he is a stranger, a poor man, has done me an ill turn, is or has been my rival, or is not of my mind, or has voted against me. Judgment is perverted when any consideration of this kind is admitted into the scale, any thing but pure right. 2. Those that are partial will be paltry. Those that have once broken through the bonds of equity, though, at first, it must be some great bribe, some noble present, that would bias them, yet, when they have debauched their consciences, they will, at length, be so sordid that

If ever they come to be convinced of the evil of those sinful courses they were flattered in, and to be ashamed of the pride and vanity which were humoured and gratified by those flatteries, they will hate the fawning flatterers as having had an ill design upon them, and the fulsome flatteries as having had an ill effect upon them and become nauseous. 2. Reprovers may displease those at first who yet afterwards, when the passion is over and the bitter physic begins to work well, will love and respect them. He that deals faithfully with his friend, in telling him of his faults, though he may put him into some heat for the present, and perhaps have hard words, instead of thanks, for his pains, yet afterwards he will not only have the comfort in his own bosom of having done his duty, but he also whom he reproved will acknowledge that it was a kindness, will entertain a high opinion of his wisdom and faithfulness, and look upon him as fit to be a friend.

     As Christ shows the absurdity and wickedness of those children who think it is no duty, in some cases, to maintain their parents (Matt. 15:5), so Solomon here shows the absurdity and wickedness of those who think it is no sin to rob their parents, either by force or secretly, by wheedling them or threatening them, or by wasting what they have, and (which is no better than robbing them) running into debt and leaving them to pay it. Now, 1. This is commonly made light of by untoward children; they say, “
     <i>
      It is no transgression
     </i>
     , for it will be our own shortly, our parents can well enough spare it, we have occasion for it, we cannot live as gentlemen upon the allowance our parents give us, it is too strait for us.” With such excuses as these they endeavour to shift off the conviction. But, 2. How lightly soever an ungoverned youth makes of it, it is really a very great sin; he that does it
     <i>
      is the companion of a destroyer
