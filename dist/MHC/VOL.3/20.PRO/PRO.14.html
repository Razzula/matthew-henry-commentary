     Note, 1. A good wife is a great blessing to a family. By a fruitful wife a family is multiplied and replenished with children, and so built up. But by a prudent wife, one that is pious, industrious, and considerate, the affairs of the family are made to prosper, debts are paid, portions raised, provision made, the children well educated and maintained, and the family has comfort within doors and credit without; thus is the house built. She looks upon it as her own to take care of, though she knows it is her husband’s to bear rule in, Est. 1:22. 2. Many a family is brought to ruin by ill housewifery, as well as by ill husbandry. A
     <i>
      foolish
     </i>
     woman, that has no fear of God nor regard to her business, that is wilful, and wasteful, and humoursome, that indulges her ease and appetite, and is all for jaunting and feasting, cards and the play-house, though she come to a plentiful estate, and to a family beforehand, she will impoverish and waste it, and will as certainly be the ruin of her house as if she
     <i>
      plucked it down with her hands
     </i>
     ; and the husband himself, with all his care, can scarcely prevent it.

     Here are, 1. Grace and sin in their true colours. Grace reigning is a reverence of God, and gives honour to him who is infinitely great and high, and to whom all honour is due, than which what is more becoming or should be more pleasing to the rational creature? Sin reigning is no less than a contempt of God. In
     <i>
      this
     </i>
     , more than in any thing, sin appears exceedingly sinful, that it despises God, whom angels adore. Those that despise God’s precepts, and will not be ruled by them, his promises, and will not accept of them, despise God himself and all his attributes. 2. Grace and sin in their true light. By this we may know a man that has grace, and the fear of God, reigning in him,
     <i>
      he walks in his uprightness
     </i>
     , he makes conscience of his actions, is faithful both to God and man, and every stop he makes, as well as every step he takes, is by rule; here is one that honours God. But, on the contrary,
     <i>
      he that is perverse in his ways
     </i>
     , that wilfully follows his own appetites and passions, that is unjust and dishonest and contradicts his profession in his conversation, however he may pretend to devotion, he is a wicked man, and will be reckoned with as a despiser of God himself.

     See here, 1. A proud fool exposing himself. Where there is pride in the heart, and no wisdom in the head to suppress it, it commonly shows itself in the words:
     <i>
      In the mouth there is pride
     </i>
     , proud boasting, proud censuring, proud scorning, proud commanding and giving law; this is the
     <i>
      rod
     </i>
     , or branch,
     <i>
      of pride
     </i>
     ; the word is used only here and Isa. 11:1. It grows from that root of bitterness which is in the heart; it is a rod from that stem. The root must be plucked up, or we cannot conquer this branch, or it is meant of a smiting beating rod, a
     <i>
      rod of pride
     </i>
     which strikes others. The proud man with his tongue lays about him and deals blows at pleasure, but it will in the end be a rod to himself; the proud man shall come under an ignominious correction by the words of his own mouth, not cut as a soldier, but caned as a servant; and herein he will be beaten with his own rod, Ps. 64:8. 2. A humble wise man saving himself and consulting his own good:
     <i>
      The lips of the wise shall preserve them
     </i>
     from doing that mischief to others which proud men do with their tongues, and from bringing that mischief on themselves which haughty scorners are often involved in.

     Note, 1. The neglect of husbandry is the way to poverty:
     <i>
      Where no oxen are
     </i>
     , to till the ground and tread out the corn,
     <i>
      the crib
     </i>
     is empty,
     <i>
      is clean
     </i>
     ; there is no straw for the cattle, and consequently no bread for the service of man. Scarcity is represented by
     <i>
      cleanness of teeth
     </i>
     , Amos 4:6.
     <i>
      Where no oxen are
     </i>
     there is nothing to be done at the ground, and then nothing to be had out of it;
     <i>
      the crib
     </i>
     indeed
     <i>
      is clean
     </i>
     from dung, which pleases the neat and nice, that cannot endure husbandry because there is so much dirty work in it, and therefore will sell their oxen to keep the crib clean; but then not only the labour, but even the dung of the ox is wanted. This shows the folly of those who addict themselves to the pleasures of the country, but do not mind the business of it, who (as we say) keep more horses than kine, more dogs than swine; their families must needs suffer by it. 2. Those who take pains about their ground are likely to reap the profit of it. Those who keep that about them which is for use and service, not for state and show, more husbandmen than footmen, are likely to thrive.
     <i>
      Much increase is by the strength of the ox
     </i>
     ; that is made for our service, and is profitable alive and dead.

     In the administration of justice much depends upon the witnesses, and therefore it is necessary to the common good that witnesses be principled as they ought to be; for, 1. A witness that is conscientious will not dare to give in a testimony that is in the least untrue, nor, for good-will or ill-will, represent a thing otherwise than according to the best of his knowledge, whoever is pleased or displeased, and then judgment runs down like a river. 2. But a witness that will be bribed, and biassed, and browbeaten,

     Note, 1. The reason why some people seek wisdom, and do not find it, is because they do not seek it from a right principle and in a right manner. They are scorners, and it is in scorn that they ask instruction, that they may ridicule what is told them and may cavil at it. Many put questions to Christ, tempting him, and that they might have whereof to accuse him, but they were never the wiser. No marvel if those who seek wisdom, as Simon Magus sought the gifts of the Holy Ghost, to serve their pride and covetousness, do not find it, for they seek amiss. Herod desired to see a miracle, but he was a scorner, and therefore it was denied him, Luke 23:8. Scorners speed not in prayer. 2. To those who understand aright, who
     <i>
      depart from evil
     </i>
     (for
     <i>
      that is understanding
     </i>
     ), the
     <i>
      knowledge
     </i>
     of God and of his will
     <i>
      is easy
     </i>
     . The parables which harden scorners in their scorning, and make divine things more difficult to them, enlighten those who are willing to learn, and make the same things more plain, and intelligible, and familiar to them,

     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Matt.13.16">

     . The same word which to the scornful
     <i>
      is a savour of death unto death
     </i>
     to the humble and serious
     <i>
      is a savour of life unto life
     </i>
     . He
     <i>
      that understands
     </i>
     , so as to
     <i>
      depart from evil
     </i>
     (for
     <i>
      that is understanding

     ), to quit his prejudices, to lay aside all corrupt dispositions and affections, will easily apprehend instruction and receive the impressions of it.

     See here, 1. The good conduct of a wise and good man; he manages himself well. It is not the wisdom of the learned, which consists only in speculation, that is here recommended, but
     <i>
      the wisdom of the prudent
     </i>
     , which is practical, and is of use to direct our counsels and actions. Christian prudence consists in a right
     <i>
      understanding of our way
     </i>
     ; for we are travellers, whose concern it is, not to spy wonders, but to get forward towards their journey’s end. It
     <i>
      is to understand our own way
     </i>
     , not to be critics and busybodies in other men’s matters, but to look well to ourselves and
     <i>
      ponder the path of our feet

     , to understand the directions of our way, that we may observe them, the dangers of our way, that we may avoid them, the difficulties of our way, that we may break through them, and the advantages of our way, that we may improve them—to understand the rules we are to walk by and the ends we are to walk towards, and walk accordingly. 2. The bad conduct of a bad man; he puts a cheat upon himself. He does not rightly understand his way; he thinks he does, and so misses his way, and goes on in his mistake:
     <i>
      The folly of fools is deceit
     </i>
     ; it cheats them into their own ruin. The folly of him that built on the sand was deceit.

     See here, 1. How wicked people are hardened in their wickedness: they
     <i>
      make a mock at sin
     </i>
     . They make a laughing matter of the sins of others, making themselves and their companions merry with that for which they should mourn, and they make a light matter of their own sins, both when they are tempted to sin and when they have committed it; they
     <i>
      call evil good and good evil
     </i>
     (Isa. 5:20), turn it off with a jest, rush into sin (Jer. 8:6) and say they shall have peace though they go on. They care not what mischief they do by their sins, and laugh at those that tell them of it. They are advocates for sin, and are ingenious at framing excuses for it.
     <i>
      Fools make a mock at the sin-offering
     </i>
     (so some); those that make light of sin make light of Christ. Those are fools that make light of sin, for they make light of that which God complains of (Amos 2:13), which lay heavily upon Christ, and which they themselves will have other thoughts of shortly. 2. How good people are encouraged in their goodness:
     <i>
      Among the righteous there is favour

We must not censure the griefs of others, for we know not what they feel; their stroke perhaps is heavier than their groaning. 2. Many enjoy a secret pleasure, especially in divine consolations, which others are not aware of, much less are sharers in; and, as the sorrows of a penitent, so the joys of a believer are such as a

     This shows the vanity of carnal mirth, and proves what Solomon said of laughter, that
     <i>
      it is mad
     </i>
     ; for, 1. There is sadness under it. Sometimes when sinners are under convictions, or some great trouble, they dissemble their grief by a forced mirth, and put a good face on it, because they will not seem to yield: they cry not when he binds them. Nay, when men really are merry, yet at the same time there is some alloy or other to their mirth, something that casts a damp upon it, which all their gaiety cannot keep from their heart. Their consciences tell them they have no reason to be merry (Hos. 9:1); they cannot but see the vanity of it. Spiritual joy is seated in the soul; the joy of the hypocrite is but from the teeth outward. See
     <span class="bibleref" title="John.16.22">

     <i>
      The end of that mirth is heaviness

      for all these things God shall bring the
     </i>
     sinner
     <i>

     Note, 1. Holy fear is an excellent guard upon every holy thing, and against every thing that is unholy. It is wisdom to depart
     <i>
      from evil
     </i>
     , from the evil of sin, and thereby from all other evil; and therefore it is wisdom to fear, that is, to be jealous over ourselves with a godly jealousy, to keep up a dread of God’s wrath, to be afraid of coming near the borders of sin or dallying with the beginnings of it. A wise man, for fear of harm, keeps out of harm’s way, and starts back in a fright when he finds himself entering into temptation. 2. Presumption is folly. He who, when he is warned of his danger,
     <i>
      rages and is confident

     Note, 1. Passionate men are justly laughed at. Men who are peevish and touchy, and are
     <i>
      soon angry
     </i>
     upon every the least provocation,
     <i>
      deal foolishly
     </i>
     ; they say and do that which is ridiculous, and so expose themselves to contempt; they themselves cannot but be ashamed of it when the heat is over. The consideration of this should engage those especially who are in reputation for wisdom and honour with the utmost care to bridle their passion. 2. Malicious men are justly dreaded and detested, for they are much more dangerous and mischievous to all societies:
     <i>
      A man of wicked devices
     </i>
     , who stifles his resentments till he has an opportunity of being revenged, and is secretly plotting how to wrong his neighbour and to do him an ill turn, as Cain to kill Abel, such a man as this is hated by all mankind. The character of an angry man is pitiable; through the surprise of a temptation he disturbs and disgraces himself, but it is soon over, and he is sorry for it. But that of a spiteful revengeful man is odious; there is no fence against him nor cure for him.

      The simple

They are as fond of it as a man of his inheritance, hold it as fast, and are as loth to part with it. What they value themselves upon is really foolish; and what will be the issue of their simplicity but folly? They will for ever rue their own foolish choice. 2. Wisdom is the honour of the wise:

     themselves

They shall have the praise of it; wise heads shall be respected as if they were crowned heads. They
     <i>
      crown knowledge

     That is, 1. The wicked are oftentimes impoverished and brought low, so that they are forced to beg, their wickedness having reduced them to straits; while good men, by the blessing of God, are enriched, and enabled to give, and do give, even to the evil; for where God grants life we must not deny a livelihood. 2.

     This shows, not what should be, but what is the common way of the world—to be shy of the poor and fond of the rich. 1. Few will give countenance to those whom the world frowns upon, though otherwise worthy of respect:

     In these two verses we are invited and encouraged to live in the fear of God by the advantages which attend a religious life. The
     <i>
      fear of the Lord
     </i>
     is here put for all gracious principles, producing gracious practices. 1. Where this reigns it produces a holy security and serenity of mind. There is in it a
     <i>
      strong confidence
     </i>
     ; it enables a man still to hold fast both his purity and his peace, whatever happens, and gives him boldness before God and the world.
     <i>
      I know that I shall be justified—None of these things move me
     </i>
     ; such is the language of this confidence. 2. It entails a blessing upon posterity. The children of those that by faith make God their confidence shall be encouraged by the promise that God will be a God to believers and to their seed to flee to him as their refuge, and they shall find shelter in him. The children of religious parents often do the better for their parents’ instructions and example and fare the better for their faith and prayers. “
     <i>
      Our fathers trusted in thee
     </i>
     , therefore we will.” 3. It is an over-flowing ever-flowing spring of comfort and joy; it is
     <i>
      a fountain of life
     </i>
     , yielding constant pleasure and satisfaction to the soul, joys that are pure and fresh, are life to the soul, and quench its thirst, and can never be drawn dry; it is a
     <i>
      well of living water
     </i>
     , that is springing up to, and is the earnest of, eternal life. 4. It is a sovereign antidote against sin and temptation. Those that have a true relish of the pleasures of serious godliness will not be allured by the baits of sin to swallow its hook; they know where to obtain better things than any it can pretend to offer, and therefore it is easy to them
     <i>
      to depart from the snares of death
     </i>
     and to keep their foot from being taken in them.

     Here are two maxims in politics, which carry their own evidence with them:—1. That it is much for the honour of a king to have a populous kingdom; it is a sign that he rules well, since strangers are hereby invited to come and settle under his protection and his own subjects live comfortably; it is a sign that he and his kingdom are under the blessing of God, the effect of which is being fruitful and multiplying. It is his strength, and makes him considerable and formidable; happy is the king, the father of his country, who has his
     <i>
      quiver full of arrows

     ; he
     <i>
      shall not be ashamed, but shall speak with his enemy in the gate

And let all that wish well to the kingdom of Christ, and to his honour, do what they can in their places that many may be added to his church. 2. That when the people are lessened the prince is weakened:
     <i>
      In the want of people is the leanness of the prince
     </i>
     (so some read it); trade lies dead, the ground lies untilled, the army wants to be recruited, the navy to be manned, and all because there are not hands sufficient. See how much the honour and safety of kings depend upon their people, which is a reason why they should rule by love, and not with rigour. Princes are corrected by those judgments which abate the number of the people, as we find, 2 Sam. 24:13.

     <i>

If fools have a little smattering of knowledge, they take all occasions, though very foreign, to produce it, and bring it in by head and shoulders. Or the folly that

     , Deut. 26:19. 2. Vice, reigning in a nation, puts disgrace upon it:
     <i>

     city or kingdom, and renders them despicable among their neighbours. The people of Israel were often instances of both parts of this observation; they were great when they were good, but when they forsook God all about them insulted them and trampled on them.

     This shows that in a well-ordered court and government smiles and favours are dispensed among those that are employed in public trusts according to their merits; Solomon lets them know he will go by that rule, 1. That those who behave themselves wisely shall be respected and preferred, whatever enemies they may have that seek to undermine them. No man’s services shall be neglected to please a party or a favourite. 2. That those who are selfish and false, who betray their country, oppress the poor, and sow discord, and thus
     <i>
      cause shame
     </i>
     , shall be displaced and banished the court, whatever friends they may make to speak for them.
