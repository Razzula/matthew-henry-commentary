     Here, 1. The obstinacy of many wicked people in a wicked way is to be greatly lamented. They are
     <i>
      often reproved
     </i>
     by parents and friends, by magistrates and ministers, by the providence of God and by their own consciences, have had their sins set in order before them and fair warning given them of the consequences of them, but all in vain; they
     <i>
      harden their necks
     </i>
     . Perhaps they fling away, and will not so much as give the reproof a patient hearing; or, if they do, yet they go on in the sins for which they are reproved; they will not bow their necks to the yoke, but are children of Belial; they refuse reproof (Prov. 10:17), despise it (Prov. 5:12), hate it, Prov. 12:1. 2. The issue of this obstinacy is to be greatly dreaded: Those that go on in sin, in spite of admonition,
     <i>
      shall be destroyed
     </i>
     ; those that will not be reformed must expect to be ruined; if the rods answer not the end, expect the axes. They
     <i>
      shall be suddenly destroyed
     </i>
     , in the midst of their security,
     <i>
      and without remedy
     </i>
     ; they have sinned against the preventing remedy, and therefore let them not expect any recovering remedy. Hell is remediless destruction. They
     <i>
      shall be destroyed, and no healing
     </i>
     , so the word is. If God wounds, who can heal?

 Proverbs 29:3

    <p>
     Both the parts of this verse repeat what has been often said, but, on comparing them together, the sense of them will be enlarged from each other. 1. Be it observed, to the honour of a virtuous young man, that he
     <i>
      loves wisdom
     </i>
     , he is
     <i>
      a philosopher
     </i>
     (for that signifies
     <i>
      a lover of wisdom
     </i>
     ), for religion is the best philosophy; he avoids bad company, and especially the company of lewd women. Hereby he
     <i>
      rejoices his
     </i>
     parents, and has the satisfaction of being a comfort to them, and increases his estate, and is likely to live comfortably. 2. Be it observed, to the reproach of a vicious young man, that he hates
     <i>
      wisdom; he keeps company with
     </i>
     scandalous women, who will be his ruin, both in soul and body; he grieves his parents, and, like the prodigal son, devours their living
     <i>
      with harlots
     </i>
     . Nothing will beggar men sooner than the lusts of uncleanness; and the best preservative from those ruinous lusts is
     <i>
      wisdom

     Here is, 1. The happiness of a people under a good government. The care and business of a prince should be to
     <i>
      establish the land
     </i>
     , to maintain its fundamental laws, to settle the minds of his subjects and make them easy, to secure their liberties and properties from hostilities and for posterity, and to set in order the things that are wanting; this he must do
     <i>
      by judgment
     </i>
     , by wise counsels, and by the steady administration of justice, without respect of persons, which will have these good effects. 2. The misery of a people under a bad government:
     <i>
      A man of oblations
     </i>
     (so it is in the margin)
     <i>
      overthrows the land
     </i>
     ; a man that is either sacrilegious or superstitious, or that invades the priest’s office, as Saul and Uzziah—or a man that aims at nothing but getting money, and will, for a good bribe, connive at the most guilty, and, in hope of one, persecute the innocent—such governors as these will ruin a country.

     Those may be said to
     <i>
      flatter their neighbours
     </i>
     who commend and applaud that good in them (the good they do or the good they have) which really either is not or is not such as they represent it, and who profess that esteem and that affection for them which really they have not; these
     <i>
      spread a net for their feet
     </i>
     . 1. For their neighbours’ feet, whom they
     <i>
      flatter
     </i>
     . They have an ill design in it; they would not praise them as they do but that they hope to make an advantage of them; and it is therefore wisdom to suspect those who flatter us, that they are secretly laying a snare for us, and to stand on our guard accordingly. Or it has an ill effect on those who are flattered; it puffs them up with pride, and makes them conceited and confident of themselves, and so proves a net that entangles them in sin. 2. For their own feet; so some understand it. He that flatters others, in expectation that they will return his compliments and flatter him, does but make himself ridiculous and odious even to those he flatters.

     Here is, 1. The peril of a sinful way. There is not only a punishment at the end of it, but
     <i>
      a snare
     </i>
     in it. One sin is a temptation to another, and there are troubles which, as
     <i>
      a snare
     </i>
     , come suddenly upon evil men in the midst of their transgressions; nay, their transgression itself often involves them in vexations; their sin is their punishment, and they are
     <i>
      holden in the cords of their own iniquity
     </i>
     , Prov. 5:22. 2. The pleasantness of the way of holiness. The snare that is
     <i>
      in the transgression of evil men
     </i>
     spoils all their mirth,
     <i>
      but righteous
     </i>
     men are kept from those snares, or delivered out of them; they walk at liberty, walk in safety, and therefore they
     <i>
      sing and rejoice
     </i>
     . Those that make God their chief joy have him for their exceeding joy, and it is their own fault if they do not
     <i>
      rejoice evermore
     </i>

     It is a pity but that every one who sues

      sub formâ pauperis

     —
     <i>
      as a pauper
     </i>
     , should have an honest cause (they are of all others inexcusable if they have not), because the scripture has so well provided that it should have a fair hearing, and that the judge himself should be of counsel, as for the prisoner, so for the pauper. 1. It is here made the character of a
     <i>
      righteous
     </i>
     judge that he
     <i>
      considers the cause of the poor
     </i>
     . It is every man’s duty to consider the poor (Ps. 41:1), but the judgment of the poor is to be considered by those that sit in judgment; they must take as much pains to find out the right in a poor man’s cause as in a rich man’s. Sense of justice must make both judge and advocate as solicitous and industrious in the poor man’s cause as if they hoped for the greatest advantage. 2. It is made the character of a
     <i>
      wicked
     </i>
     man that because it is a poor man’s cause, which there is nothing to be got by, he
     <i>
      regards not to know it

     See here, 1. Who are the men that are dangerous to the public—
     <i>
      scornful men
     </i>
     . When such are employed in the business of the state they do things with precipitation, because they scorn to deliberate, and will not take time for consideration and consultation; they do things illegal and unjustifiable, because they scorn to be hampered by laws and constitutions; they break their faith, because they scorn to be bound by their word, and provoke the people, because they scorn to please them. Thus they
     <i>
      bring a city into a snare
     </i>
     by their ill conduct, or (as the margin reads it) they
     <i>
      set a city on fire

     <i>

     that mock at religion, the obligations of conscience, the fears of another world, and every thing that is sacred and serious. Such men are the plagues of their generation; they bring God’s judgments upon a land, set men together by the ears, and so bring all to confusion. 2. Who are the men that are the blessings of a land—the
     <i>

     who by promoting religion, which is true wisdom,
     <i>

     A wise man is here advised not to set his wit to a fool’s, not to dispute with him, or by contending with him to think either of fastening reason upon him or gaining right from him:
     <i>
      If a wise man contend with a wise man
     </i>
     , he may hope to be understood, and, as far as he has reason and equity on his side, to carry his point, at least to bring the controversy to a head and make it issue amicably; but, if he
     <i>
      contend with a foolish man, there is no rest
     </i>
     ; he will see no end of it, nor will he have any satisfaction in it, but must expect to be always uneasy. 1. Whether the foolish man he contends with
     <i>
      rage or laugh
     </i>
     , whether he take angrily or scornfully what is said to him, whether he rail at it or mock at it, one of the two he will do, and so there will be
     <i>
      no rest

     . However it is given, it will be ill-taken, and the wisest man must expect to be either scolded or ridiculed if he
     <i>
      contend with a fool
     </i>
     . He that fights with a dunghill, whether he be conqueror or conquered, is sure to be defiled. 2. Whether the wise man himself

     <i>

     Parents, in educating their children, must consider, 1. The benefit of due correction. They must not only tell their children what is good and evil, but they must chide them, and correct them too, if need be, when they either neglect that which is good or do that which is evil. If a
     <i>
      reproof
     </i>
     will serve without
     <i>
      the rod
     </i>
     , it is well, but
     <i>
      the rod
     </i>
     must never be used without a rational and grave
     <i>
      reproof
     </i>
     ; and then, though it may be a present uneasiness both to the father and to the child, yet it will
     <i>
      give wisdom. Vexatio dat intellectum—Vexation sharpens the intellect
     </i>
     . The child will take warning, and so will get
     <i>
      wisdom
     </i>
     . 2. The mischief of undue indulgence:
     <i>
      A child
     </i>
     that is not restrained or reproved, but is
     <i>
      left to himself
     </i>
     , as Adonijah was, to follow his own inclinations, may do well if he will, but, if he take to ill courses, nobody will hinder him; it is a thousand to one but he proves a disgrace to his family, and
     <i>
      brings his mother
     </i>
     , who fondled him and humoured him in his licentiousness,
     <i>
      to shame
     </i>
     , to poverty, to reproach, and perhaps will himself be abusive to her and give her ill language.

     Note, 1. The more sinners there are the more sin there is:
     <i>
      When the wicked
     </i>
     , being countenanced by authority, grow numerous, and walk on every side, no marvel if
     <i>
      transgression increases
     </i>
     , as a plague in the country is said to increase when still more and more are infected with it.
     <i>
      Transgression
     </i>
     grows more impudent and bold, more imperious and threatening, when there are many to keep it in countenance. In the old world, when
     <i>
      men began to multiply
     </i>
     , they began to degenerate and corrupt themselves and one another. 2. The more sin there is the nearer is the ruin threatened. Let not
     <i>
      the righteous
     </i>
     have their faith and hope shocked by the increase of sin and sinners. Let them not say that they have
     <i>
      cleansed their hands in vain
     </i>
     , or that
     <i>
      God has forsaken the earth
     </i>
     , but wait with patience; the transgressors shall fall, the measure of their iniquity will be full, and then they shall fall from their dignity and power, and fall into disgrace and destruction, and
     <i>
      the righteous shall
     </i>
     have the satisfaction of
     <i>
      seeing their fall
     </i>
     (Ps. 37:34), perhaps in this world, certainly in the judgment of the great day, when the fall of God’s implacable enemies will be the joy and triumph of glorified saints. See

     Note, 1. It is a very happy thing when children prove the comfort of their parents. Good children are so; they
     <i>
      give them rest
     </i>
     , make them easy, and free from the many cares they have had concerning them;
     <i>
      yea

     , they
     <i>
      give delight unto their souls

     . It is a pleasure to parents, which none know but those that are blessed with it, to see the happy fruit of the good education they have given their children, and to have a prospect of their well-doing for both worlds; it
     <i>
      gives delight
     </i>
     proportionable to the many thoughts of heart that have been concerning them. 2. In order to this, children must be trained up under a strict discipline, and not suffered to do what they will and to go without rebuke when they do amiss. The foolishness bound up in their hearts must by correction be driven out when they are young, or it will break out, to their own and their parents’ shame, when they are grown up.

     See here, I. The misery of the people that want a settled ministry:
     <i>
      Where there is no vision
     </i>
     , no prophet to expound the law, no priest or Levite to teach the good knowledge of the Lord, no means of grace, the word of the Lord is scarce, there is

     (1 Sam. 3:1), where it is so
     <i>
      the people perish
     </i>
     ; the word has many significations, any of which will apply here. 1.
     <i>
      The people are made naked
     </i>
     , stripped of their ornaments and so exposed to shame, stripped of their armour and so exposed to danger. How bare does a place look without Bibles and ministers, and what an easy prey is it to the enemy of souls! 2.
     <i>
      The people rebel
     </i>
     , not only against God, but against their prince; good preaching would make people good subjects, but, for want of it, they are turbulent and factious, and
     <i>
      despise dominions
     </i>
     , because they know no better. 3.
     <i>
      The people are idle
     </i>
     , or
     <i>
      they play
     </i>
     , as the scholars are apt to do when the master is absent; they do nothing to any good purpose, but stand all the day idle, and sporting in the market-place, for want of instruction what to do and how to do it. 4.
     <i>
      They are scattered as sheep having no shepherd
     </i>
     , for want of the masters of assemblies to call them and keep them together, Mark 6:34. They are scattered from God and their duty by apostasies, from one another by divisions; God is provoked to scatter them by his judgments,

     Here is the description of an unprofitable, slothful, wicked servant, a slave that serves not from conscience, or love, but purely from fear. Let those that have such servants put on patience to bear the vexation and not disturb themselves at it. See their character. 1. No rational words will work upon them; they

     Note, 1. It is an imprudent thing in a master to be too fond of a servant, to advance him too fast, and admit him to be too familiar with him, to suffer him to be over-nice and curious in his diet, and clothing, and lodging, and so to bring him up delicately, because he is a favourite, and an agreeable servant; it should be remembered that he is a servant, and, by being thus indulged, will be spoiled for any other place. Servants must endure hardness. 2. It is an ungrateful thing in a servant, but what is very common, to behave insolently because he has been used tenderly. The humble prodigal thinks himself unworthy
     <i>
      to be called a son
     </i>
     , and is content to be a servant; the pampered slave thinks himself too good to be called
     <i>
      a servant
     </i>
     , and will be
     <i>
      a son at the length
     </i>
     , will take his ease and liberty, will be on a par with his master, and perhaps pretend to the inheritance. Let masters
     <i>
      give their servants that which is equal
     </i>
     and fit for them, and neither more nor less. This is very applicable to the body, which 265a is a servant to the soul; those that
     <i>
      delicately bring up
     </i>
     the body, that humour it, and are over-tender of it, will find that at length it will forget its place, and
     <i>
      become a son

     See here the mischief that flows from an angry, passionate, furious disposition. 1. It makes men provoking to one another:
     <i>
      An angry man stirs up strife
     </i>
     , is troublesome and quarrelsome in the family and in the neighbourhood, blows the coals, and even forces those to fall out with him that would live peaceable and quietly by him. 2. It makes men provoking to God:

     <i>
      seek the ruler’s favour

     , and, as if all their judgment proceeded from him, to him they make all their court. Solomon was himself a

     <i>

Haman had
     <i>
      the ruler’s favour

     , and yet it availed him nothing. 2. What is the wisest course men can take to be happy. Let them look up to God, and seek the favour of the Ruler of rulers; for
     <i>
      every man’s judgment proceeds from the Lord

     This expresses not only the innate contrariety that there is between virtue and vice, as between light and darkness, fire and water, but the old enmity that has always been between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent, Gen. 3:15. 1. All that are sanctified have a rooted antipathy to wickedness and wicked people. They have a good will to the souls of all (God has, and would have none perish); but they hate the ways and practices of those that are impious towards God and injurious towards men; they cannot hear of them nor speak of them without a holy indignation; they loathe the society of the ungodly and unjust, and dread the thought of giving them any countenance, but do all they can to bring the wickedness of the wicked to an end. Thus
     <i>
      an unjust
     </i>
     man makes himself odious
     <i>
      to the just
     </i>
     , and it is one part of his present shame and punishment that good men cannot endure him. 2. All that are unsanctified have a like rooted antipathy to godliness and godly people:
     <i>
      He that is upright in the way
     </i>
     , that makes conscience of what he says and does,
     <i>
      is an abomination to the wicked
     </i>
     , whose wickedness is restrained perhaps and suppressed, or, at least, shamed and condemned, by the uprightness of the upright. Thus Cain did, who was
     <i>
      of his father the devil
     </i>
     . And this is not only the wickedness of the wicked, that they hate those whom God loves, but their misery too, that they hate those whom them shall shortly see in everlasting bliss and honour, and who shall have
     <i>
      dominion over them in the morning
