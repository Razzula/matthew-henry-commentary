     As we read this, it teaches us a great truth, that we are not sufficient of ourselves to
     <i>
      think or speak any thing of ourselves
     </i>
     that is wise and good, but that all
     <i>
      our sufficiency is of God
     </i>
     , who is with the heart and with the mouth, and
     <i>
      works in us both to will and to do
     </i>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Phil.2.13">
      Phil. 2:13

     ;
     <span class="bibleref" title="Ps.10.17">
      Ps. 10:17
     </span>
     . But most read it otherwise:
     <i>
      The preparation of the heart is in man
     </i>
     (he may contrive and design this and the other) but
     <i>
      the answer of the tongue
     </i>
     , not only the delivering of what he designed to speak, but the issue and success of what he designed to do,
     <i>
      is of the Lord
     </i>
     . That is, in short, 1.
     <i>
      Man purposes
     </i>
     . He has a freedom of thought and a freedom of will permitted him; let him form his projects, and lay his schemes, as he thinks best: but, after all, 2.
     <i>
      God disposes
     </i>
     . Man cannot go on with his business without the assistance and blessing of God, who
     <i>
      made man’s mouth
     </i>
     and teaches us what we shall say. Nay, God easily can, and often does, cross men’s purposes, and break their measures. It was a curse that was prepared in Balaam’s heart, but the answer of the tongue was a blessing.

     Note, 1. We are all apt to be partial in judging of ourselves:
     <i>
      All the ways of a man
     </i>
     , all his designs, all his doings,
     <i>
      are clean in his own eyes
     </i>
     , and he sees nothing amiss in them, nothing for which to condemn himself, or which should make his projects prove otherwise than well; and therefore he is confident of success, and that the answer of the tongue shall be according to the expectations of the heart; but there is a great deal of pollution cleaving to our ways, which we are not aware of, or do not think so ill of as we ought. 2. The judgment of God concerning us, we are sure, is according to truth: He
     <i>
      weighs the spirits
     </i>
     in a just and unerring balance, knows what is in us, and passes a judgment upon us accordingly, writing
     <i>
      Tekel
     </i>
     upon that which passed our scale with approbation—
     <i>
      weighed in the balance and found wanting
     </i>
     ; and by his judgment we must stand or fall. He not only sees men’s ways but tries their spirits, and we are as our spirits are.

    <p>
     Note, 1. It is a very desirable thing to have
     <i>
      our thoughts established
     </i>
     , and not tossed, and put into a hurry, by disquieting cares and fears,—to go on in an even steady course of honesty and piety, not disturbed, or put out of frame, by any event or change,—to be satisfied that all shall work for good and issue well at last, and therefore to be always easy and sedate. 2. The only way to have our
     <i>
      thoughts established
     </i>
     is to
     <i>
      commit our works to the Lord
     </i>
     . The great concerns of our souls must be committed to the grace of God, with a dependence upon and submission to the conduct of that grace (2 Tim. 1:12); all our outward concerns must be committed to the providence of God, and to the sovereign, wise, and gracious disposal of that providence.
     <i>
      Roll thy works upon the Lord
     </i>
     (so the word is); roll the burden of thy care from thyself upon God. Lay the matter before him by prayer.
     <i>
      Make known thy works unto the Lord
     </i>
     (so some read it), not only the works of thy hand, but the workings of thy heart; and then leave it with him, by faith and dependence upon him, submission and resignation to him.
     <i>
      The will of the Lord be done
     </i>
     . We may then be easy when we resolve that whatever pleases God shall please us.

     Note, 1. That God is the first cause. He is the former of all things and all persons, the fountain of being; he gave every creature the being it has and appointed it its place. Even the wicked are his creatures, though they are rebels; he gave them those powers with which they fight against him, which aggravates their wickedness, that they will not let him that made them rule them, and therefore, though he made them, he will not save them. 2. That God is the last end. All is of him and from him, and therefore all is to him and for him. He made all according to his will and for his praise; he designed to serve his own purposes by all his creatures, and he will not fail of his designs; all are his servants. The wicked he is not glorified by, but he will be glorified upon. He makes no man wicked, but he made those who he foresaw would be wicked: yet he made them (Gen. 6:6), because he knew how to
     <i>
      get himself honour upon them
     </i>
     . See Rom. 9:22. Or (as some understand it) he made the wicked to be employed by him as the instruments of his wrath in the day of evil, when he brings judgments on the world. He makes some use even of wicked men, as of other things, to be his sword, his hand (

     Note, 1. The pride of sinners sets God against them. He that, being high in estate is proud in heart, whose spirit is elevated with his condition, so that he becomes insolent in his conduct towards God and man, let him know that though he admires himself, and others caress him, yet he is
     <i>

Though they may strengthen one another with their confederacies and combinations, joining forces against God, they shall not escape his righteous judgment.

     Note, 1. God can turn foes into friends when he pleases. He that has all hearts in his hand has access to men’s spirits and power over them, working insensibly, but irresistibly upon them, can make
     <i>
      a man’s enemies to be at peace with him
     </i>
     , can change their minds, or force them into a feigned submission. He can slay all enemies, and bring those together that were at the greatest distance from each other. 2. He will do it for us when we please him. If we make it our care to be reconciled to God, and to keep ourselves in his love, he will incline those that have been envious towards us, and vexatious to us, to entertain a good opinion of us and to become our friends. God made Esau to be at peace with Jacob, Abimelech with Isaac, and David’s enemies to court his favour and desire a league with Israel. The image of God appearing upon the righteous, and his particular lovingkindness to them, are enough to recommend them to the respect of all, even of those that have been most prejudiced against them.

     Here, 1. It is supposed that an honest good man may have but a little of the wealth of this world (all the righteous are not rich),—that a man may have but little, and yet may be honest (though poverty is a temptation to dishonesty, Prov. 30:9; yet not an invincible one),—and that a man may grow rich, for a while, by fraud and oppression, may have
     <i>
      great revenues

     , and those got and kept
     <i>
      without right

     , may have no good title to them nor make any good use of them. 2. It is maintained that a small estate, honestly come by, which a man is content with, enjoys comfortably, serves God with cheerfully, and puts to a right use, is much better and more valuable than a great estate ill-got, and then ill-kept or ill-spent. It carries with it more inward satisfaction, a better reputation with all that are wise and good; it will last longer, and will turn to a better account in the great day, when men will be judged, not according to what they had, but what they did.

     Man is here represented to us, 1. As a reasonable creature, that has the faculty of contriving for himself:
     <i>
      His heart devises his way
     </i>
     , designs an end, and projects ways and means leading to that end, which the inferior creatures, who are governed by sense and natural instinct, cannot do. The more shame for him if he do not devise the way how to please God and provide for his everlasting state. 2. But as a depending creature, that is subject to the direction and dominion of his Maker. If men
     <i>
      devise their way

     We wish this were always true as a proposition, and we ought to make it our prayer for kings, and all in authority, that a
     <i>
      divine sentence
     </i>
     may be in their lips, both in giving orders, that they may do that in wisdom, and in giving sentence, that they may do that in equity, both which are included in
     <i>
      judgment
     </i>
     , and that in neither
     <i>
      their mouth may transgress
     </i>
     , 1 Tim. 2:1. But it is often otherwise; and therefore, 1. It may be read as a precept to the kings and judges of the earth to be wise and instructed. Let them be just, and rule in the fear of God; let them act with such wisdom and conscience that there may appear a holy divination in all they say or do, and that they are guided by principles supernatural: let not their mouths transgress in judgment, for the judgment is God’s. 2. It may be taken as a promise to all good kings, that if they sincerely aim at God’s glory, and seek direction from him, he will qualify them with wisdom and grace above others, in proportion to the eminency of their station and the trusts lodged in their hands. When Saul himself was made king God gave him another spirit. 3. It was true concerning Solomon who wrote this; he had extraordinary wisdom, pursuant to the promise God made him, See 1 Kgs. 3:28.

     Note, 1. The administration of public justice by the magistrate is an ordinance of God; in it the scales are held, and ought to be held by a steady and impartial hand; and we ought to submit to it, for the Lord’s sake, and to see his authority in that of the magistrate,

He has also appointed by his law that they be just. It is therefore a great affront to him, and to his government, to falsify, and so to do wrong under colour and pretence of doing right, which is

     Here is, 1. The character of a good king, which Solomon intended not for his own praise, but for instruction to his successors, his neighbours, and the viceroys under him. A good king not only does justice, but it is
     <i>
      an abomination
     </i>
     to him to do otherwise. He hates the thought of doing wrong and perverting justice; he not only abhors the wickedness done by others, but abhors the wickedness done by others, but abhors to do any himself, though, having power, he might easily and safety do it. 2. The comfort of a good king: His

He that makes conscience of using his power aright shall find that to be the best security of his government, both as it will oblige people, make them easy, and keep them in the interest of it, and as it will obtain the blessing of God, which will be a firm basis to the throne and a strong guard about it.

They not only do righteousness themselves, but take care to employ those under them that do righteousness too, which is of great consequence to the people, who must be subject not only to the king as supreme, but to the governors sent by him, 1 Pet. 2:14. A good king will therefore put those in power who are conscientious, and will say that which is righteous and discreet, and know how to speak aright and to the purpose.

    <p>
     These two verses show the power of kings, which is every where great, but was especially so in those eastern countries, where they were absolute and arbitrary. Whom they would they slew and whom they would they kept alive. Their will was a law. We have reason to bless God for the happy constitution of the government we live under, which maintains the prerogative of the prince without any injury to the liberty of the subject. But here it is intimated, 1. How formidable
     <i>
      the wrath of a king is
     </i>
     : It is
     <i>
      as messengers of death
     </i>
     ; the wrath of Ahasuerus was so to Haman. An angry word from an incensed prince has been to many a
     <i>
      messenger of death
     </i>
     , and has struck so great a terror upon some as if a sentence of death had been pronounced upon them. He must be a very
     <i>
      wise man
     </i>
     that knows how to
     <i>
      pacify
     </i>
     the wrath of a king with a word fitly spoken, as Jonathan once pacified his father’s rage against David, 1 Sam. 19:6. A prudent subject may sometimes suggest that to an angry prince which will cool his resentments. 2. How valuable and desirable the king’s favour is to those that have incurred his displeasure; it is life from the dead if the king be reconciled to them. To others it is
     <i>
      as a cloud of the latter rain
     </i>
     , very refreshing to the ground. Solomon put his subjects in mind of this, that they might not do any thing to incur his wrath, but be careful to recommend themselves to his favour. We ought by it to be put in mind how much we are concerned to escape the wrath and obtain the favour of the King of kings. His frowns are worse than death, and his favour is better than life; and therefore those are fools who to escape the wrath, and obtain the favour, of an earthly prince, will throw themselves out of God’s favour, and make themselves obnoxious to his wrath.

     Solomon here not only asserts that it is better to get wisdom than gold (

      Prov. 3:14
     </span>
     ;
     <span class="bibleref" title="Prov.8.19">
      8:19

     ), but he speaks it with assurance, that it is much better, better beyond expression—with admiration (
     <i>
      How much better
     </i>
     !) as one amazed at the disproportion—with an appeal to men’s consciences (“Judge in yourselves how much better it is” )--and with an addition to the same purport, that understanding is
     <i>
      rather to be chosen than silver
     </i>
     and all the treasures of kings and their favourites. Note, 1. Heavenly wisdom is better than worldly wealth, and to be preferred before it. Grace is more valuable than gold. Grace is the gift of God’s peculiar favour; gold only of common providence. Grace is for ourselves; gold for others. Grace is for the soul and eternity; gold only for the body and time. Grace will stand us in stead in a dying hour, when gold will do us no good. 2. The getting of this heavenly wisdom is better than the getting of worldly wealth. Many take care and pains to get wealth, and yet come short of it; but grace was never denied to any that sincerely sought it. There is vanity and vexation of spirit in getting wealth, but joy and satisfaction of spirit in getting wisdom.

      the way of the upright
     </i>
     to avoid sin, and every thing that looks like it and leads towards it; and this is a highway marked out by authority, tracked by many that have gone before us, and in which we meet with many that keep company with us; it is easy to find and safe to be travelled in, like a highway, Isa. 35:8.
     <i>
      To depart from evil is understanding
     </i>
     . 2. It is the care of the upright to preserve their own souls, that they be not polluted with sin, and that by the troubles of the world they may not be put out of the possession of them, especially that they may not perish for ever, Matt. 16:26. And it is therefore their care to keep their way, and not turn aside out of it, on either hand, but to press towards perfection. Those that adhere to their duty secure their felicity. Keep thy way and God will keep thee.

     Note, 1. Pride will have a fall. Those that are of a
     <i>
      haughty spirit
     </i>
     , that think of themselves above what is meet, and look with contempt upon others, that with their pride affront God and disquiet others, will be brought down, either by repentance or by ruin. It is the honour of God to humble the proud,

     . It is the act of justice that those who have lifted up themselves should be laid low. Pharaoh, Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar, were instances of this. Men cannot punish pride, but either admire it or fear it, and therefore God will take the punishing of it into his own hands. Let him alone to deal with proud men. 2. Proud men are frequently most proud, and insolent, and haughty, just before their destruction, so that it is a certain presage that they are upon the brink of it. When proud men set God’s judgments at defiance, and think themselves at the greatest distance from them, it is a sign that they are at the door; witness the case of Benhadad and Herod.
     <i>
      While the word was in the king’s mouth

     This is a paradox which the children of this world cannot understand and will not subscribe to, that it is better to be poor and humble than to be rich and proud. 1. Those that
     <i>
      divide the spoil
     </i>
     are commonly proud; they value themselves and despise others, and their mind rises with their condition; those therefore that are
     <i>
      rich in this world
     </i>
     have need to be charged that they
     <i>
      be not high-minded
     </i>
     , 1 Tim. 6:17. Those that are proud and will put forth themselves, that thrust, and shove, and scramble, for preferment, are the men that commonly
     <i>
      divide the spoil
     </i>
     and share it among them; they have the world at will and the ball at their foot. 2. It is upon all accounts better to take our lot with those whose condition is low, and their minds brought to it, than to covet and aim to make a figure and a bustle in the world. Humility, though it should expose us to contempt in the world, yet while it recommends us to the favour of God, qualifies us for his gracious visits, prepares us for his glory, secures us from many temptations, and preserves the quiet and repose of our own souls, is much better than that high-spiritedness which, though it carry away the honour and wealth of the world, makes God a man’s enemy and the devil his master.

     <i>
      He that handles a matter wisely

     This recommends the grace of meekness to us, which will well become us all, particularly
     <i>
      the hoary head

     , Prov. 16:31. Observe, 1. The nature of it. It is to be
     <i>
      slow to anger
     </i>
     , not easily put into a passion, nor apt to resent provocation, taking time to consider before we suffer our passion to break out, that it may not transgress due bounds, so slow in our motions towards anger that we may be quickly stopped and pacified. It is to have the rule of our own spirits, our appetites and affections, and all our inclinations, but particularly our passions, our anger, keeping that under direction and check, and the strict government of religion and right reason. We must be
     <i>
      lords of our anger
     </i>
     , as God is, Nah. 1:3.
     <i>
      Aeolus sis, affectuum tuorum—Rule your passions, as Aeolus rules the winds

     . 2. The honour of it. He that gets and keeps the mastery of his passions

     or by a long war subdues a country. Behold, a greater than Alexander or Caesar is here. The conquest of ourselves, and our own unruly passions, requires more true wisdom, and a more steady, constant, and regular management, than the obtaining of a victory over the forces of an enemy. A rational conquest is more honourable to a rational creature than a brutal one. It is a victory that does nobody any harm; no lives or treasures are sacrificed to it, but only some base lusts. It is harder, and therefore more glorious, to quash an insurrection at home than to resist an invasion from a broad; nay, such are the gains of meekness that by it
