     Here see, 1. What will be the credit and comfort of a poor man, and make him more excellent than his neighbour, though his poverty may expose him to contempt and may dispirit him. Let him be honest and
     <i>
      walk in integrity
     </i>
     , let him keep a good conscience and make it appear that he does so, let him always speak and act with sincerity when he is under the greatest temptations to dissemble and break his word, and then let him value himself upon that, for all wise and good men will value him. He is better, has a better character, is in a better condition, is better beloved, and lives to better purpose, than many a one that looks great and makes a figure. 2. What will be the shame of a rich man, notwithstanding all his pomp. If he have a shallow head and an evil tongue, if he is
     <i>
      perverse in his lips and is a fool
     </i>
     , if he is a wicked man and gets what he has by fraud and oppression, he
     <i>

     Two things are here declared to be of bad consequence:—1. Ignorance:
     <i>
      To be without the knowledge of the soul is not good
     </i>
     , so some read it. Know we not our own selves, our own hearts?
     <i>
      A soul without knowledge is not good
     </i>
     ; it is a great privilege that we have souls, but, if these souls have not knowledge, what the better are we? If man
     <i>
      has not understanding, he is as the beasts
     </i>
     , Ps. 49:20. An ignorant soul cannot be a good soul. That the soul be without knowledge is not safe, nor pleasant; what good can the soul do, of what is it good for, if it be without knowledge? 2. Rashness.
     <i>
      He that hastes with his feet
     </i>
     (that does things inconsiderately and with precipitation, and will not take time to ponder the path of his feet)

   <div class="article">
    <p>
     We have here two instances of men’s folly:—1. That they bring themselves into straits and troubles, and run themselves a-ground, and embarrass themselves:
     <i>
      The foolishness of man perverts his way
     </i>
     . Men meet with crosses and disappointments in their affairs, and things do not succeed as they expected and wished, and it is owing to themselves and their own folly; it is their own iniquity that corrects them. 2. That when they have done so they lay the blame upon God, and their hearts fret against him, as if he had done them wrong, whereas really they wrong themselves. In fretting, we are enemies to our own peace, and become self-tormentors; in
     <i>
      fretting against the Lord
     </i>
     we affront him, his justice, goodness, and sovereignty; and it is very absurd to take occasion from the trouble which we pull upon our own heads by our wilfulness, or neglect, to quarrel with him, when we ought to blame ourselves, for it is our own doing. See Isa. 50:1.

    <p>
     Here, 1. We may see how strong men’s love of money is, that they will love any man, how undeserving soever he be otherwise, if he has but a deal of money and is free with it, so that they may hope to be the better for it. Wealth enables a man to send many presents, make many entertainments, and do many good offices, and so gains him many friends, who pretend to love him, for they flatter him and make their court to him, but really love what he has, or rather love themselves, hoping to get by him. 2. We may see how weak men’s love of one another is. He who, while he prospered, was beloved and respected, if he fall into poverty is
     <i>
      separated from his neighbour
     </i>
     , is not owned nor looked upon, not visited nor regarded, is bidden to keep his distance and told he is troublesome. Even one that has been his neighbour and acquaintance will turn his face from him and pass by on the other side. Because men’s consciences tell them they ought to relieve and succour such, they are willing to have this excuse, that they did not see them.

 Proverbs 19:5

    <p>
     Here we have, 1. The sins threatened—bearing
     <i>
      false witness
     </i>
     in judgment and
     <i>
      speaking lies
     </i>
     in common conversation. Men could not arrive at such a pitch of impiety as to bear false witness (where to the guilt of a lie is added that of perjury and injury) if they had not advanced to it by allowing themselves to speak untruths in jest and banter, or under pretence of doing good. Thus men
     <i>
      teach their tongues to speak lies
     </i>
     , Jer. 9:5. Those that will take a liberty to tell lies in discourse are in a fair way to be guilty of the greater wickedness of false-witness-bearing, whenever they are tempted to it, though they seemed to detest it. Those that can swallow a false word debauch their consciences, so that a false oath will not choke them. 2. The threatening itself: They
     <i>
      shall not go unpunished
     </i>
     ; they
     <i>
      shall not escape
     </i>
     . This intimates that that which emboldens them in the sin is the hope of impunity, it being a sin which commonly escapes punishment from men, though the law is strict,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Deut.19.18">

     <i>

 Proverbs 19:6–7
</h2>
<div class="exbib-content">
 <div>
  <div>
   <div class="article">
    <p>
     These two verses are a comment upon Prov. 18:4; and show, 1. How those that are rich and great are courted and caressed, and have suitors and servants in abundance. The prince that has power in his hand, and preferments at his disposal, has his gate and his ante-chamber thronged with petitioners, that are ready to adore him for what they can get.
     <i>
      Many will entreat his favour
     </i>
     , and think themselves happy in it. Even great men are humble suppliants to the prince. How earnest then should we be for the favour of God, which is far beyond that of any earthly prince. But, it should seem, liberality will go further than majesty itself to gain respect, for there are many that court the prince, but
     <i>
      every man is a friend to him that gives gifts
     </i>
     ; not only those that have received, or do expect, gifts from him, will, as friends, be ready to serve him, but others also will, as friends, give him their good word. Prodigals, who are foolishly free of what they have, will have many hangers-on who will cry them up as long as it lasts, but will leave them when it is done. Those that are prudently generous make an interest by it which may stand them in good stead; those that are accounted benefactors exercise an authority which may give them an opportunity of doing good, Luke 22:25. 2. How those that are poor and low are slighted and despised. Men may, if they please, court the prince, and the princely, but they may not trample upon the poor and look at them with disdain. Yet so it often is:
     <i>
      All the brethren of the poor do hate him
     </i>
     ; even his own relations are shy of him, because he is needy and craving, and expects something from them, and because they look upon him as a blemish to their family; and then no marvel if others of his friends, that were nothing akin to him,
     <i>
      go far from him
     </i>
     , to get out of his way.
     <i>
      He pursues them with words
     </i>
     , hoping to prevail with them by his importunity to be kind to him, but all in vain; they have nothing for him.
     <i>
      They pursue him with words
     </i>
     (so some understand it), to excuse themselves from giving him any thing; they tell him that he is idle and impertinent, that he has brought himself into poverty, and therefore ought not to be relieved; as Nabal said to David’s messengers: “
     <i>
      There are many servants now a days that run away from their masters
     </i>
     ; and how do I know but that David may be one of them?” Let poor people therefore make God their friend, pursue him with their prayers, and he will not be wanting to them.

     <i>

     Note, 1. Pleasure and liberty ill become a fool:
     <i>
      Delight is not seemly for
     </i>
     such a one. A man that has not wisdom and grace has no right nor title to true joy, and therefore it is unseemly. It ill becomes those that do not delight in God to delight in any thing, nor how to manage themselves, and therefore they do but expose themselves. It becomes ungracious fools to be afflicted, and mourn, and weep, not to laugh and be merry; rebukes are more proper for them than delights. Delight is seemly for a man of business, to refresh him when he is fatigued, but not
     <i>
      for a fool
     </i>
     , that lives an idle life and abuses his recreations.
     <i>
      The prosperity of fools
     </i>
     discovers their folly and
     <i>
      destroys them

     <i>
      for a servant to have rule over princes
     </i>
     ; it is absurd in itself, and very preposterous, for none are so insolent and intolerable as a beggar on horseback,
     <i>
      a servant when he reigns

     A wise man will observe these two rules about his anger: 1. Not to be over-hasty in his resentments:
     <i>
      Discretion
     </i>
     teaches us to
     <i>
      defer our anger
     </i>
     , to defer the admission of it till we have thoroughly considered all the merits of the provocation, seen them in a true light and weighed them in a just balance; and then to defer the prosecution of it till there be no danger of running into any indecencies. Plato said to his servant, “I would beat thee, but that I am angry.” Give it time, and it will cool. 2. Not to be over-critical in his resentments. Whereas it is commonly looked upon as a piece of ingenuity to apprehend an affront quickly, it is here made a man’s
     <i>
      glory to pass over a transgression
     </i>
     , to appear as if he did not see it (Ps. 38:13), or, if he sees fit to take notice of it, yet to forgive it and meditate no revenge.

They are not like those of common persons; their frowns are very terrible and their smiles very comfortable, and therefore it concerns them to be very careful that they never frighten a good man from doing well with their frowns, nor ever give countenance to a wicked man in doing ill with their smiles, for then they abuse their influence, Rom. 13:3. 2. To make subjects faithful and dutiful to their princes. Let them be restrained from all disloyalty by the consideration of the dreadful consequence of having the government against them; and let them be encouraged in all good services to the public by the hopes of the favour of their prince. Christ is a King whose wrath against his enemies will be

     It is an instance of the vanity of the world that we are liable to the greatest grief in those things wherein we promise ourselves the greatest comfort. It is as it proves. What greater temporal comfort can a man have than a good wife and good children? Yet, 1.
     <i>
      A foolish son is
     </i>
     a great affliction, and may make a man wish a thousand times he had been written childless. A son that will apply himself to no study or business, that will take no advice, that lives a lewd, loose, rakish life, and spends what he has extravagantly, games it away and wastes it in the excess of riot, or that is proud, foppish, and conceited, such a one is the grief
     <i>
      of his father
     </i>
     , because he is the disgrace, and is likely to be the ruin, of his family. He hates all his labour, when he sees to whom he must leave the fruit of it. 2. A cross peevish wife is as great an affliction: Her
     <i>
      contentions are continual
     </i>
     ; every day, and every hour in the day, she finds some occasion to make herself and those about her uneasy. Those that are accustomed to chide never want something or other to chide at; but it is

     Note, 1. A discreet and virtuous wife is a choice gift of God’s providence to a man—a wife that is
     <i>
      prudent
     </i>
     , in opposition to one that is contentious, Prov. 18:13. For, though a wife that is continually finding fault may think it is her wit and wisdom to be so, it is really her folly;
     <i>
      a prudent wife
     </i>
     is meek and quiet, and makes the best of every thing. If a man has such a wife, let him not ascribe it to the wisdom of his own choice or his own management (for the wisest have been deceived both in and by a woman), but let him ascribe it to the goodness of God, who made him a help meet for him, and perhaps by some hits and turns of providence that seemed casual brought her to him. Every creature is what he makes it. Happy marriages, we are sure, are made in heaven; Abraham’s servant prayed in the belief of this, Gen. 24:12. 2. It is a more valuable gift than
     <i>
      house and riches
     </i>
     , contributes more to the comfort and credit of a man’s life and the welfare of his family, is a greater token of God’s favour, and about which the divine providence is in a more especial manner conversant. A good estate may be
     <i>
      the inheritance of fathers
     </i>
     , which, by the common direction of Providence, comes in course to a man; but no man has a good wife by descent or entail. Parents that are worldly, in disposing of their children, look no further than to match them to
     <i>
      house and riches
     </i>
     , but, if withal it be to
     <i>
      a prudent wife

     Parents are here cautioned against a foolish indulgence of their children that are untoward and viciously inclined, and that discover such an ill temper of mind as is not likely to be cured but by severity. 1. Do not say that it is all in good time to correct them; no, as soon as ever there appears a corrupt disposition in them check it immediately, before it gets head, and takes root, and is hardened into a habit:
     <i>
      Chasten thy son while there is hope
     </i>
     , for perhaps, if he be let alone awhile, he will be past hope, and a much greater chastening will not do that which now a less would effect. It is easiest plucking up weeds as soon as they spring up, and the bullock that is designed for the yoke should be betimes accustomed to it. 2. Do not say that it is a pity to correct them, and that, because they cry and beg to be forgiven, you cannot find in your heart to do it. If the point can be gained without correction, well and good; but if you find, as it often proves, that your forgiving them once, upon a dissembled repentance and promise of amendment, does but embolden them to offend again, especially if it be a thing that is in itself sinful (as lying, swearing, ribaldry, stealing, or the like), in such a case put on resolution,
     <i>
      and let not thy soul spare for his crying
     </i>
     . It is better that he should cry under thy rod than under the sword of the magistrate, or, which is more fearful, that of divine vengeance.

     1. As we read this, it intimates, in short, that angry men never want woe. Those that are of strong, or rather headstrong, passions, commonly bring themselves and their families into trouble by vexatious suits and quarrels and the provocations they give; they are still smarting, in one instance or other, for their ungoverned heats; and, if their friends deliver them out of one trouble, they will quickly involve themselves in another, and they
     <i>
      must do it again
     </i>
     , all which troubles to themselves and others would be prevented if they would mortify their passions and get the rule of their own spirits. 2. It may as well be read,
     <i>
      He that is of great wrath
     </i>
     (meaning the child that is to be corrected and is impatient of rebuke, cries and makes a noise, even that wrath of his against the rod of correction)

     Note, 2c6c 1. The honour of doing good is what we may laudably be ambitious of. It cannot but be
     <i>
      the desire of man
     </i>
     , if he have any spark of virtue in him, to be kind; one would not covet an estate for any thing so much as thereby to be put into a capacity of relieving the poor and obliging our friends. 2. It is far better to have a heart to do good and want ability for it than have ability for it and want a heart to it:
     <i>
      The desire of a man
     </i>
     to be kind, and charitable, and generous,
     <i>
      is his kindness

     See what those that get by it that live in the fear of God, and always make conscience of their duty to him. 1. Safety: They
     <i>

     ; they may be visited with sickness or other afflictions, but there shall be no evil in them, nothing to hurt them, because nothing to separate them

He hugs himself in his own ease and is resolved against labour and hardship. Let those work that love it; for his part he thinks there is no such fine life as sitting still and doing nothing. 2. He will not be at the pains to feed himself, an elegant hyperbole; as we say, A man is so lazy that he would not shake fire off him, so here, He cannot find in his heart to take his hand out of his bosom, no, not to put meat into his own mouth. If the law be so that those that will not labour must not eat, he will rather starve than stir. Thus his sin is his punishment, and therefore is egregious folly.

     Here is, 1. The sin of a prodigal son. Besides the wrong he does to himself, he is injurious to his good parents, and basely ungrateful to those that were instruments of his being and have taken so much care and pains about him, which is a great aggravation of his sin and renders it exceedingly sinful in the eyes of God and man:
     <i>
      He wastes is father

The shame of a prodigal son. It is a shame to himself that he should be so brutish and unnatural. He makes himself odious to all mankind.

     This is a good caution to those that have had a good education to take heed of hearkening to those who, under pretence of instructing them, draw them off from those good principles under the influence of which they were trained up. Observe, 1. There is that which seems designed for instruction, but really tends to the destruction of young men. The factors for vice will undertake to teach them free thoughts and a fashionable conversation, how to palliate the sins they have a mind to and stop the mouth of their own consciences, how to get clear of the restraints of their education and to set up for wits and beaux. This is
     <i>
      the instruction
     </i>
     which
     <i>
      causes to err from the
     </i>
     forms of sound words, which should be held fast in faith and love. 2. It is the wisdom of young men to turn a deaf ear to such instructions, as the adder does to the charms that are designed to ensnare her. “Dread hearing such talk as tends top instil loose principles into the mind; and, if thou art linked in with such, break off from them; thou hast heard enough, or too much, and therefore hear no more of the evil communication which corrupts good manners.”

     <i>
      scorns judgment

Tell him of law and equity, that the scriptures and an oath are sacred things, and not to be jested with, that there will come a reckoning day; he laughs at it all, and scorns to heed it. 2.
