    <p>
     As religion towards God is a branch of universal righteousness (he is not an honest man that is not devout), so righteousness towards men is a branch of true religion, for he is not a godly man that is not honest, nor can he expect that his devotion should be accepted; for, 1. Nothing is more offensive to God than deceit in commerce.
     <i>
      A false balance
     </i>
     is here put for all manner of unjust and fraudulent practices in dealing with any person, which are all an
     <i>
      abomination to the Lord
     </i>
     , and render those abominable to him that allow themselves in the use of such accursed arts of thriving. It is an affront to justice, which God is the patron of, as well as a wrong to our neighbour, whom God is the protector of. Men make light of such frauds, and think there is no sin in that which there is money to be got by, and, while it passes undiscovered, they cannot blame themselves for it; a blot is no blot till it is hit,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Hos.12.7">
      Hos. 12:7
     </span>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Hos.12.8">
      8
     </span>
     . But they are not the less an abomination to God, who will be the avenger of those that are defrauded by their brethren. 2. Nothing is more pleasing to God than fair and honest dealing, nor more necessary to make us and our devotions acceptable to him:
     <i>
      A just weight is his delight
     </i>
     . He himself goes by a just weight, and holds the scale of judgment with an even hand, and therefore is pleased with those that are herein followers of him. A balance cheats, under pretence of doing right most exactly, and therefore is the greater abomination to God.

  <div>
   <div class="article">
    <p>
     Observe, 1. How he that exalts himself is here abased, and contempt put upon him.
     <i>
      When pride comes then comes shame
     </i>
     . Pride is a sin which men have reason to be themselves ashamed of; it is a shame to a man who springs out of the earth, who lives upon alms, depends upon God, and has forfeited all he has, to be proud. It is a sin which others cry out shame on and look upon with disdain; he that is haughty makes himself contemptible; it is a sin for which God often brings men down, as he did Nebuchadnezzar and Herod, whose ignominy immediately attended their vain-glory; for God
     <i>
      resists the proud
     </i>
     , contradicts them, and counterworks them, in the thing they are proud of, Isa. 2:11 2. How he that humbles himself is here exalted, and a high character is given him. As with the proud there is folly, and will be shame, so
     <i>
      with the lowly there is wisdom
     </i>
     , and will be honour, for a man’s wisdom gains him respect and makes his face to shine before men; or, if any be so base as to trample upon the humble, God will give them grace which will be their glory. Considering how safe, and quiet, and easy, those are that are of a humble spirit, what communion they have with God and comfort in themselves, we will say,
     <i>
      With the lowly is wisdom

     It is not only promised that God will guide the upright, and threatened that he will destroy the transgressors, but, that we may be the more fully assured of both, it is here represented as if the nature of the thing were such on both sides that it would do it itself. 1. The integrity of an honest man will itself be his guide in the way of duty and the way of safety. His principles are fixed, his rule is certain, and therefore his way is plain; his sincerity keeps him steady, and he needs not tack about every time the wind turns, having no other end to drive at than to keep a good conscience.
     <i>
      Integrity and uprightness
     </i>
     will

     men, Ps. 25:21. 2. The iniquity of a bad man will itself be his ruin. As the plainness of a good man will be his protection, though he is ever so much exposed, so the perverseness of sinners will be their destruction, though they think themselves eve so well fortified. They shall fall into pits of their own digging, Prov. 5:22.

     Note, 1. The
     <i>
      day of death
     </i>
     will be a
     <i>
      day of wrath
     </i>
     . It is a messenger of God’s wrath; therefore when Moses had meditated on man’s mortality he takes occasion thence to admire
     <i>
      the power of God’s anger
     </i>
     , Ps. 90:11. It is a debt owing, not to nature, but to God’s justice.

      After death the judgment
     </i>
     , and that is a
     <i>
      day of wrath
     </i>
     , Rev. 6:17. 2. Riches will stand men in no stead that day. They will neither put by the stroke nor ease the pain, much less take out the sting; what profit will this world’s birth-rights be of then? In the day of public judgments riches often expose men rather than protect them, Ezek. 7:19. 3. It is righteousness only that will
     <i>
      deliver from
     </i>
     the evil of
     <i>
      death
     </i>

     These two verses are, in effect, the same, and both to the same purport with Prov. 11:3. For the truths are here of such certainty and weight that they cannot be too often inculcated. Let us govern ourselves by these principles.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     I. That the ways of religion are plain and safe, and in them we may enjoy a holy security. A living principle of honesty and grace will be, 1. Our best direction in the right way, in every doubtful case to say to us,
     <i>
      This is the way, walk in it
     </i>

   <div class="article">
    <p>
     Note, 1. Even wicked men, while they live, may keep up a confident expectation of a happiness when they die, or at least a happiness in this world. The hypocrite has his hope, in which he wraps himself as the spider in her web. The worldling expects great matters from his wealth; he calls it
     <i>
      goods laid up for many years
     </i>
     , and hopes to take his ease in it and to be merry; but in death their expectation will be frustrated: the worldling must leave this world which he expected to continue in and the hypocrite will come short of that world which he expected to remove to, Job 27:8. 2. It will be the great aggravation of the misery of wicked people that their hopes will sink into despair just when they expect them to be crowned with fruition. When a godly man dies his expectations are out-done, and all his fears vanish; but when a wicked man dies his expectations are dashed, dashed to pieces; in that very day his thoughts perish with which he had pleased himself, his hopes vanish.

     As always in death, so sometimes in life, the righteous are remarkably favoured and the wicked crossed. 1. Good people are helped out of the distresses which they thought themselves lost in, and their feet are set in a large room,

The wicked have fallen into the distresses which they thought themselves far from, nay, which they had been instrumental to bring the righteous into, so that they seem to come in their stead, as a ransom for the just. Mordecai is saved from the gallows, Daniel from the lion’s den, and Peter from the prison; and their persecutors

 Proverbs 11:10–11

    <p>
     It is here observed,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     I. That good men are generally well-beloved by their neighbours, but nobody cares for wicked people. 1. It is true there are some few that are enemies to the righteous, that are prejudiced against God and godliness, and are therefore vexed to see good men in power and prosperity; but all indifferent persons, even those that have no great stock of religion themselves, have a good word for a good man; and therefore
     <i>
      when it goes well with the righteous
     </i>
     , when they are advanced and put into a capacity of doing good according to their desire, it is so much the better for all about them, and
     <i>
      the city rejoices
     </i>
     . For the honour and encouragement of virtue, and as it is the accomplishment of the promise of God, we should be glad to see virtuous men prosper in the world, and brought into reputation. 2. Wicked people may perhaps have here and there a well-wisher among those who are altogether such as themselves, but among the generality of their neighbours they get ill-will; they may be feared, but they are not loved, and therefore
     <i>
      when they perish there is shouting
     </i>
     ; every body takes a pleasure in seeing them disgraced and disarmed, removed out of places of trust and power, chased out of the world, and wishes no greater loss may come to the town, the rather because they hope
     <i>
      the righteous may come in their stead
     </i>
     , as they into trouble instead of the righteous, Prov. 11:8. Let a sense of honour therefore keep us in the paths of virtue, that we may live desired and die lamented, and not be hissed off the stage,

    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     II. That there is good reason for this, because those that are good do good, but (
     <i>
      as saith the proverb of the ancients) wickedness proceeds from the wicked
     </i>
     . 1.
     <i>
      Good men are public blessings
     </i>
     —
     <i>
      Vir bonus est commune bonum. By the blessing of the upright
     </i>
     , the blessings with which they are blessed, which enlarge their sphere of usefulness,—by the blessings with which they bless their neighbours, their advice, their example, their prayers, and all the instances of their serviceableness to the public interest,—by the blessings with which God blesses others for their sake,—by these
     <i>
      the city is exalted
     </i>
     and made more comfortable to the inhabitants, and more considerable among its neighbours. 2. Wicked men are public nuisances, not only the burdens, but the plagues of their generation. The city is
     <i>
      overthrown by the mouth of the wicked
     </i>
     , whose evil communications corrupt good manners, are enough to debauch a town, to ruin virtue in it, and bring down the judgments of God upon it.

     I. Silence is here recommended as an instance of true friendship, and a preservative of it, and therefore an evidence, 1. Of wisdom:
     <i>
      A man of understanding
     </i>
     , that has rule over his own spirit, if he be provoked,
     <i>
      holds his peace

     discovers his folly by this; he

      A tale-bearer

     Here we are taught, 1. In general, that we may not use our estates as we will (he that gave them to us has reserved to himself a power to direct us how we shall use them, for they are not our own; we are but stewards), and further that God in his law consults our interests and teaches us that charity which begins at home, as well as that which must not end there. There is a good husbandry which is good divinity, and a discretion in ordering our affairs which is part of the character of a good man, Ps. 112:5. Every man must be just to his family, else he is not true to his stewardship. 2. In particular, that we must not enter rashly into suretiship, (1.) Because there is danger of bringing ourselves into trouble by it, and our families too when we are gone:
     <i>
      He that is surety for a stranger

      it pleased the Lord to bruise him

     . (2.) Because he that resolves against all such suretiship keeps upon sure grounds, which a man may do if he take care not to launch out any further into business than his own credit will carry him, so that he needs not ask others to be bound for him.

      satisfy thy soul
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      make fat thy bones
     </i>
     . Some make it part of the character of a
     <i>
      merciful man
     </i>
     , that he will make much of himself; that disposition which inclines him to be charitable to others will oblige him to allow himself also that which is convenient and to
     <i>
      enjoy the good of all his labour
     </i>
     . We may by the
     <i>
      soul
     </i>
     understand the
     <i>
      inward man
     </i>
     , as the apostle calls it, and then it teaches us that the first and great act of mercy is to provide well for our own souls the necessary supports of the spiritual life. 2. A
     <i>
      cruel
     </i>
     , froward, ill-natured man,
     <i>
      troubles his own flesh
     </i>
     , and so his sin becomes his punishment; he starves and dies for want of what he has, because he has not a heart to use it either for the good of others of for his own. He is vexatious to his nearest relations, that are, and should be, to him as his own flesh, Eph. 5:29. Envy, and malice, and greediness of the world, are the rottenness of the bones and the consumption of the flesh.

     It is here shown that righteousness, not only by the divine judgment, will end in life, and wickedness in death, but that righteousness, in its own nature, has a direct tendency to life and wickedness to death. 1. True holiness is true happiness; it is a preparative for it, a pledge and earnest of it.
     <i>
      Righteousness
     </i>
     inclines, disposes, and leads, the soul

     It concerns us to know what God hates and what he loves, that we may govern ourselves accordingly, may avoid his displeasure and recommend ourselves to his favour. Now here we are told, 1. That nothing is more offensive to God than hypocrisy and double-dealing, for these are signified by the word which we translate
     <i>
      frowardness
     </i>
     , pretending justice, but intending wrong, walking in crooked ways, to avoid discovery. Those
     <i>
      are of a froward heart

      Such as are upright in their way
     </i>
     , such as aim and act with integrity, such as have their conversation in the world

     , though there are many that concur by their practice to keep wickedness in countenance, and engage to stand by one another in defending it against all the attacks of virtue and justice,—though they are in league for the support and propagation of it,—though wicked children tread in the steps of their wicked parents, and resolve to keep up the trade, in defiance of religion,—yet all this will not protect them from the justice of God; they shall not be held guiltless; it will not excuse them to say that they did as the most did and as their company did; they

It is lamented that beauty should be so abused as it is by those that have not modesty with it. It seems ill-bestowed upon them; it is quite misplaced,

     Note, 1. It is possible a man may grow rich by prudently spending what he has, may scatter in works of piety, charity, and generosity, and yet may increase; nay, by that means may increase, as the corn is increased by being sown. By cheerfully using what we have our spirits are exhilarated, and so fitted for the business we have to do, by minding which closely what we have is increased; it gains a reputation which contributes to the increase. But it is especially to be ascribed to God; he blesses the giving hand, and so makes it a getting hand, 2 Cor. 9:10.
     <i>
      Give, and it shall be given you

     So backward we are to works of charity, and so ready to think that giving undoes us, that we need to have it very much pressed upon us how much it is for our own advantage to do good to others, as before, Prov. 11:17. 1. We shall have the comfort of it in our own bosoms:
     <i>
      The liberal soul
     </i>
     , the soul of blessing, that prays for the afflicted and provides for them, that scatters blessings with gracious lips and generous hands, that soul

     See here, 1. What use we are to make of the gifts of God’s bounty; we must not hoard them up merely for our own advantage, that we may be enriched by them, but we must bring them forth for the benefit of others, that they may be supported and maintained by them. It is a sin, when corn is dear and scarce, to withhold it, in hopes that it will still grow dearer, so to keep up and advance the market, when it is already so high that the poor suffer by it; and at such a time it is the duty of those that have stocks of corn by them to consider the poor, and to be willing to sell at the market-price, to be content with moderate profit, and not aim to make a gain of God’s judgments. It is a noble and extensive piece of charity for those that have stores wherewithal to do it to help to keep the markets low when the price of our commodities grows excessive. 2. What regard we are to have to the voice of the people. We are not to think it an indifferent thing, and not worth heeding, whether we have the ill will and word, or the good will and word, of our neighbours, their prayers or their curses; for here we are taught to dread their curses, and forego our own profit rather than incur them; and to court their blessings, and be at some expense to purchase them.

     Two extremes in the management of family-affairs are here condemned and the ill consequences of them foretold:—1. Carefulness and carnal policy, on the one hand. There are those that by their extreme earnestness in pursuit of the world, their anxiety about their business and fretfulness about their losses, their strictness with their servants and their niggardliness towards their families,
     <i>
      trouble their own houses

     <i>
      inherit the wind

     <i>

     This shows what great blessings good men are, especially those that are eminently wise, to the places where they live, and therefore how much to be valued. 1. The righteous are as
     <i>
      trees of life
     </i>
     ; the fruits of their piety and charity, their instructions, reproofs, examples, and prayers, their interest in heaven, and their influence upon earth, are like the fruits of that tree, precious and useful, contributing to the support and nourishment of the spiritual life in many; they are the ornaments of paradise, God’s church on earth, for whose sake it stands. 2.

     <i>
      verily there is a God that judges in the earth

     </i>
     for their righteousness here
     <i>
      in the earth
     </i>
     , though that is not the principal, much less the only reward either intended for them or intended by them; but whatever the word of God has promised them, or the wisdom of God sees good for them, they shall have
     <i>
      in the earth. The wicked
     </i>
     also,
     <i>
      and the sinner
     </i>
     , are sometimes remarkably punished in this life, nations, families, particular persons. And if the righteous, who do not deserve the least reward, yet have part of their recompence here on earth, much more shall the wicked, who deserve the greatest punishment, have part of their punishment on earth, as an earnest of worse to come. Therefore
     <i>
      stand in awe and sin not
     </i>
     . If those have two heavens that merit none, much more shall those have two hells that merit both.
