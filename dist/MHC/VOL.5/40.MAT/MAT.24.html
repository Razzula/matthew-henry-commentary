  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR.

 <p class="tab-1">
  Christ’s preaching was mostly practical; but, in this chapter, we have a prophetical discourse, a prediction of things to come; such however as had a practical tendency, and was intended, not to gratify the curiosity of his disciples, but to guide their consciences and conversations, and it is therefore concluded with a practical application. The church has always had particular prophecies, besides general promises, both for direction and for encouragement to believers; but it is observable, Christ preached this prophetical sermon in the close of his ministry, as the Apocalypse is the last book of the New Testament, and the prophetical books of the Old Testament are placed last, to intimate to us, that we must be well grounded in plain truths and duties, and those must first be well digested, before we dive into those things that are dark and difficult; many run themselves into confusion by beginning their Bible at the wrong end. Now, in this chapter, we have, I. The occasion of this discourse, Matt. 24:1-3. II. The discourse itself, in which we have, 1. The prophecy of divers events, especially referring to the destruction of Jerusalem, and the utter ruin of the Jewish church and nation, which were not hastening on, and were completed about forty years after; the prefaces to that destruction, the concomitants and consequences of it; yet looking further, to Christ’s coming at the end of time, and the consummation of all things, of which that was a type and figure, Matt. 24:4-31. 2. The practical application of this prophecy for the awakening and quickening of his disciples to prepare for these great and awful things, Matt. 24:32-51.

     Here is,

    <p class="tab-1">
     I. Christ’s quitting
     <i>
      the temple
     </i>
     , and his public work there. He had said, in the close of the foregoing chapter,
     <i>
      Your house is left unto you desolate
     </i>
     ; and here he made his words good;
     <i>
      He went out, and departed from the temple
     </i>
     . The manner of expression is observable; he not only went out of the temple, but departed from it, took his final farewell of it; he departed from it, never to return to it any more; and then immediately follows a prediction of its ruin. Note, That house is left desolate indeed, which Christ leaves.

      Woe unto them when I depart

     . It was now time to groan out their
     <i>
      Ichabod, The glory is departed, their defence is departed
     </i>
     . Three days after this, the veil of the temple was rent; when Christ left it, all became
     <i>
      common and unclean
     </i>
     ; but Christ departed not till they drove him away; did not reject them, till they first rejected him.

     II. His private discourse with his disciples; he left the temple, but he did not leave the twelve, who were the seed of the gospel church, which the casting off of the Jews was the enriching of. When he left the temple, his disciples left it too, and came to him. Note, It is good being where Christ is, and leaving that which he leaves. They came to him, to be instructed in private, when his public preaching was over; for
     <i>
      the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him
     </i>
     . He had spoken of the destruction of the Jewish church to the multitude in parables, which here, as usual, he explains to his disciples. Observe,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     1.
     <i>
      His disciples came to him, to show him the buildings of the temple
     </i>
     , It was a stately and beautiful structure, one of the wonders of the world; no cost was spared, no art left untried, to make it sumptuous. Though it came short of Solomon’s temple, and
     <i>
      its beginning was small
     </i>
     , yet
     <i>
      its latter end did greatly increase
     </i>
     . It was richly furnished with gifts and offerings, to which there were continual additions made. They showed Christ these things, and desired him to take notice of them, either,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (1.) As being greatly pleased with them themselves, and expecting he should be so too. They had lived mostly in Galilee, at a distance from the temple, had seldom seen it, and therefore were the more struck with admiration at it, and thought he should admire as much as they did
     <i>
      all this glory
     </i>
     (Gen. 31:1); and they would have him divert himself (after his preaching, and from his sorrow which they saw him perhaps almost overwhelmed with) with looking about him. Note, Even good men are apt to be too much enamoured with outward pomp and gaiety, and to overvalue it, even in the things of God; whereas we should be, as Christ was, dead to it, and look upon it with contempt. The temple was indeed glorious, but, [1.] Its glory was sullied and stained with the sin of the priests and people; that wicked doctrine of the Pharisees, which preferred the gold before the temple that sanctified it, was enough to deface the beauty of all the ornaments of the temple. [2.] Its glory was eclipsed and outdone by the presence of Christ in it, who was
     <i>
      the glory of this latter house
     </i>
     (Hag. 2:9), so that the buildings had no glory, in comparison with that glory which excelled.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     Or, (2.) As grieving that this house should be left desolate; they showed him the buildings, as if they would move him to reverse the sentence; “Lord, let not this holy and beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, be made a desolation.” They forgot how many providences, concerning Solomon’s temple, had manifested how little God cared for that outward glory which they had so much admired, when the people were wicked, 2 Chron. 7:21.
     <i>
      This house, which is high
     </i>
     , sin will bring low. Christ had lately looked upon
     <i>
      the precious souls, and wept for them
     </i>
     , Luke 19:41. The disciples look upon the pompous buildings, and are ready to weep for them. In this, as in other things,
     <i>
      his thoughts are not like ours
     </i>
     . It was weakness, and meanness of spirit, in the disciples, to be so fond of fine buildings; it was a childish thing.
     <i>
      Animo magno nihil magnum—To a great mind nothing is great
     </i>
     . Seneca.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     2. Christ, hereupon, foretels the utter ruin and destruction that were coming upon this place, Matt. 24:2. Note, A believing foresight of the defacing of all worldly glory will help to take us off from admiring it, and overvaluing it. The most beautiful body will be shortly worms’ meat, and the most beautiful building a ruinous heap. And shall we then set our eyes upon that which so soon is not, and look upon that with so much admiration which ere long we shall certainly look upon with so much contempt?
     <i>
      See ye not all these things
     </i>
     ? They would have Christ look upon them, and be as much in love with them as they were; he would have them look upon them, and be as dead to them as he was. There is such a sight of these things as will do us good; so to see them as to see through them and see to the end of them.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     Christ, instead of reversing the decree, ratifies it;
     <i>
      Verily, I say unto you, there shall not be left one stone upon another
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (1.) He speaks of it as a certain ruin; “
     <i>
      I say unto you. I
     </i>
     , that know what I say, and know how to make good what I say; take my word for it, it shall be so;
     <i>
      I, the Amen, the true Witness, say it to you
     </i>
     .” All judgment being committed to the Son, the threatenings, as well as the promises, are all
     <i>
      yea, and amen, in him
     </i>
     .

     </span>
     .
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (2.) He speaks of it as an utter ruin. The temple shall not only be stripped, and plundered, and defaced, but utterly demolished and laid waste;
     <i>
      Not one stone shall be left upon another
     </i>
     . Notice is taken, in the
     <i>
      building
     </i>
     of the second temple, of the
     <i>
      laying of one stone upon another
     </i>
     (Hag. 2:15); and here, in the
     <i>
      ruin
     </i>
     , of
     <i>
      not leaving one stone upon another
     </i>
     . History tells us, that this was fulfilled in the latter; for though Titus, when he took the city, did all he could to preserve the temple, yet he could not restrain the enraged soldiers from destroying it utterly; and it was done to that degree, that Turnus Rufus ploughed up the ground on which it had stood: thus that scripture was fulfilled (Mic. 3:12),
     <i>
      Zion shall, for your sake, be ploughed as a field
     </i>
     . And afterward, in Julian the Apostate’s time, when the Jews were encouraged by him to rebuild their temple, in opposition to the Christian religion, what remained of the ruins was quite pulled down, to level the ground for a new foundation; but the attempt was defeated by the miraculous eruption of fire out of the ground, which destroyed the foundation they laid, and frightened away the builders. Now this prediction of the final and irreparable ruin of the temple includes a prediction of the period of the Levitical priesthood and the ceremonial law.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     3. The disciples, not disputing either the truth or the equity of this sentence, nor doubting of the accomplishment of it, enquire more particularly of the time when it should come to pass, and the signs of its approach, Matt. 24:3. Observe,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (1.) Where they made this enquiry; privately,
     <i>
      as he sat upon the mount of Olives
     </i>
     ; probably, he was returning to Bethany, and there sat down by the way, to rest him; the mount of Olives directly faced the temple, and from thence he might have a full prospect of it at some distance; there he sat as a Judge upon the bench, the temple and city being before him as at the bar, and thus he passed sentence on them. We read (Ezek. 11:23) of the removing of the glory of the Lord from the temple to the mountain; so Christ, the great Shechinah, here removes to this mountain.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (2.) What the enquiry itself was;
     <i>
      When shall these things be; and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world
     </i>
     ? Here are three questions.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     [1.] Some think, these questions do all point at one and the same thing—the destruction of the temple, and the period of the Jewish church and nation, which Christ had himself spoken of as his coming (Matt. 16:28), and which would be the consummation of the age (for so it may be read), the finishing of that dispensation. Or, they thought the destruction of the temple must needs be the end of the world. If that house be laid waste, the world cannot stand; for the Rabbin used to say that the house of the sanctuary was one of the seven things for the sake of which the world was made; and they think, if so, the world will not survive the temple.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     [2.] Others think their question,
     <i>
      When shall these things be
     </i>
     ? refers to the destruction of Jerusalem, and the other two to the end of the world; or Christ’s coming may refer to his setting up his gospel kingdom, and the end of the world to the day of judgment. I rather incline to think that their question looked no further than the event Christ now foretold; but it appears by other passages, that they had very confused thoughts of future events; so that perhaps it is not possible to put any certain construction upon this question of theirs.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     But Christ, in his answer, though he does not expressly rectify the mistakes of his disciples (that must be done by the pouring out of the Spirit), yet looks further than their question, and instructs his church, not only concerning the great events of that age, the destruction of Jerusalem, but concerning his second coming at the end of time, which here he insensibly slides into a discourse of, and of that it is plain he speaks in the next chapter, which is a continuation of this sermon.

 Matthew 24:4–31
</h2>
<div class="exbib-content">

   <div class="article">
    <p>
     The disciples had asked concerning the times,
     <i>
      When shall these things be
     </i>
     ? Christ gives them no answer to that, after what number of days and years his prediction should be accomplished, for
     <i>
      it is not for us to know the times
     </i>
     (Acts 1:7); but they had asked,
     <i>
      What shall be the sign
     </i>
     ? That question he answers fully, for we are concerned to
     <i>
      understand the signs of the times
     </i>
     , Matt. 16:3. Now the prophecy primarily respects the events near at hand—the destruction of Jerusalem, the period of the Jewish church and state, the calling of the Gentiles, and the setting up of Christ’s kingdom in the world; but as the prophecies of the Old Testament, which have an immediate reference to the affairs of the Jews and the revolutions of their state, under the figure of them do certainly look further, to the gospel church and the kingdom of the Messiah, and are so expounded in the New Testament, and such expressions are found in those predictions as are peculiar thereto and not applicable otherwise; so this prophecy, under the type of Jerusalem’s destruction, looks as far forward as the general judgment; and, as is usual in prophecies, some passages are most applicable to the type, and others to the antitype; and toward the close, as usual, it points more particularly to the latter. It is observable, that what Christ here saith to his disciples tends more to engage their caution than to satisfy their curiosity; more to prepare them for the events that should happen than to give them a distinct idea of the events themselves. This is that good understanding of the time which we should all covet, thence to infer what Israel ought to do: and so this prophecy is of standing lasting use to the church, and will be so to the end of time; for
     <i>
      the thing that hath been, is that which shall be
     </i>
     (
     <span class="bibleref" title="Eccl.1.5">
      Eccl. 1:5
     </span>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Eccl.1.6">

     </span>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Eccl.1.7">

     </span>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Eccl.1.9">
      9
     </span>
     ), and the series, connection, and presages, of events, are much the same still that they were then; so that upon the prophecy of this chapter, pointing at that event, moral prognostications may be made, and such constructions of the signs of the times as the wise man’s heart will know how to improve.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     I. Christ here foretels the going forth of deceivers; he begins with a caution,
     <i>
      Take heed that no man deceive you
     </i>
     . They expected to be told when these things should be, to be let into that secret; but this caution is a check to their curiosity, “
     <i>
      What is that to you
     </i>
     ? Mind you your duty, follow me, and be not seduced from following me.” Those that are most inquisitive concerning the secret things which belong not to them are most easily imposed upon by seducers, 2 Thess. 2:3. The disciples, when they heard that the Jews, their most inveterate enemies, should be destroyed, might be in danger of falling into security; “Nay,” saith Christ, “you are more exposed other ways.” Seducers are more dangerous enemies to the church than persecutors.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     Three times in this discourse he mentions the appearing of
     <i>
      false prophets
     </i>
     , which was, 1. A presage of Jerusalem’s ruin. Justly were they who killed the true prophets, left to be ensnared by false prophets; and they who crucified the true Messiah, left to be deceived and broken by false Christs and pretended Messiahs. The appearing of these was the occasion of dividing that people into parties and factions, which made their ruin the more easy and speedy; and the sin of the many that were led aside by them, helped to fill the measure. 2. It was a trial to the disciples of Christ, and therefore agreeable to their state of probation,
     <i>
      that they which are perfect, may be made manifest
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     Now concerning these deceivers, observe here,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (1.) The pretences they should come under. Satan acts most mischievously, when he appears as an angel of light: the colour of the greatest good is often the cover of the greatest evil.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     [1.] There should appear
     <i>
      false prophets
     </i>
     (Matt. 24:11-24); the deceivers would pretend to divine inspiration, an immediate mission, and a spirit of prophecy, when it was all a lie. Such they had been formerly (
     <span class="bibleref" title="Jer.23.16">
      Jer. 23:16
     </span>
     ;
     <span class="bibleref" title="Ezek.13.6">
      Ezek. 13:6
     </span>
     ), as was foretold, Deut. 13:3. Some think, the seducers here pointed to were such as had been settled teachers in the church, and had gained reputation as such, but afterward betrayed the truth they had taught, and revolted to error; and from such the danger is the greater, because least suspected. One false traitor in the garrison may do more mischief than a thousand avowed enemies without.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     [2.] There should appear
     <i>
      false Christs, coming in Christ’s name
     </i>
     (Matt. 24:5), assuming to themselves the name peculiar to him, and saying,
     <i>
      I am Christ, pseudo-christs
     </i>
     , Matt. 24:24. There was at that time a general expectation of the appearing of the Messiah; they spoke of him; as
     <i>
      he that should come
     </i>
     ; but when he did come, the body of the nation rejected him; which those who were ambitious of making themselves a name, took advantage of, and set up for Christ. Josephus speaks of several such impostors between this and the destruction of Jerusalem; one Theudas, that was defeated by Cospius Fadus; another by Felix, another by Festus. Dosetheus said he was the Christ foretold by Moses.
     <i>
      Origen adversus Celsum
     </i>
     . See
     <span class="bibleref" title="Acts.5.36">
      Acts 5:36
     </span>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Acts.5.37">
      37
     </span>
     . Simon Magus pretended to be
     <i>
      the great power of God
     </i>
     , Acts 8:10. In after-ages there have been such pretenders; one about a hundred years after Christ, that called himself
     <i>
      Bar-cochobas—The son of a star
     </i>
     , but proved
     <i>
      Bar-cosba—The son of a lie
     </i>
     . About fifty years ago Sabbati-Levi set up for a Messiah in the Turkish empire, and was greatly caressed by the Jews; but in a short time
     <i>
      his folly was made manifest
     </i>
     . See Sir Paul Rycaut’s
     <i>
      History
     </i>
     . The popish religion doth, in effect, set up a false Christ; the Pope comes, in Christ’s name, as his vicar, but invades and usurps all his offices, and so is a rival with him, and, as such, an enemy to him, a deceiver, and an antichrist.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     [3.] These false Christs and false prophets would have their agents and emissaries busy in all places to draw people in to them, Matt. 24:23.
     <i>
      Then
     </i>
     when public troubles are great and threatening, and people will be catching at any thing that looks like deliverance, then Satan will take the advantage of imposing on them; they will say,
     <i>
      Lo, here is a Christ, or there
     </i>
     is one; but do not mind them: the true Christ did not strive, nor cry; nor was it said of him,
     <i>
      Lo, here! or Lo, there
     </i>
     ! (Luke 17:21), therefore if any man say so concerning him, look upon it as a temptation. The hermits, who place religion in a monastical life, say,
     <i>
      He is in the desert
     </i>
     ; the priests, who made the consecrated wafer to be Christ, say, “He is
     <b>
      <i>
       en tois tameiois
      </i>
     </b>
     —
     <i>
      in the cupboards, in the secret chambers
     </i>
     : lo, he is in this shrine, in that image.” Thus some appropriate Christ’s spiritual presence to one party or persuasion, as if they had the monopoly of Christ and Christianity; and the kingdom of Christ must stand and fall, must live and die, with them; “Lo, he is in this church, in that council:” whereas Christ is All in all, not here or there, but meets his people with a blessing
     <i>
      in every place where he records his name
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (2.) The proof they should offer for the making good of these pretences;
     <i>
      They shall show great signs and wonders
     </i>
     (Matt. 24:24), not true miracles, those are a divine seal, and with those the doctrine of Christ stands confirmed; and therefore if any offer to draw us from that by signs and wonders, we must have recourse to that rule given of old (Deut. 13:1-3),
     <i>
      If the sign or wonder come to pass
     </i>
     , yet follow not him that would draw you
     <i>
      to serve other gods
     </i>
     , or believe in other Christs,
     <i>
      for the Lord your God proveth you
     </i>
     . But these were
     <i>
      lying wonders
     </i>
     (2 Thess. 2:9), wrought by Satan (God permitting him), who is
     <i>
      the prince of the power of the air
     </i>
     . It is not said,
     <i>
      They shall work miracles
     </i>
     , but,
     <i>
      They shall show great signs
     </i>
     ; they are but a show; either they impose upon men’s credulity by false narratives, or deceive their senses by tricks of legerdemain, or arts of divination, as the magicians of Egypt by their enchantments.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (3.) The success they should have in these attempts,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     [1.]
     <i>
      They shall deceive many
     </i>
     (Matt. 24:5), and again, Matt. 24:11. Note, The devil and his instruments may prevail far in deceiving poor souls; few find the strait gate, but many are drawn into the broad way; many will be imposed upon by their signs and wonders, and many drawn in by the hopes of deliverance from their oppressions. Note, Neither miracles nor multitudes are certain signs of a true church; for
     <i>
      all the world wonders after the beast
     </i>
     , Rev. 13:3.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     [2.]
     <i>
      They shall deceive, if it were possible, the very elect
     </i>
     , Matt. 24:24. This bespeaks,
     <i>
      First

     , The strength of the delusion; it is such as many shall be carried away by (so strong shall the stream be), even those that were thought to stand fast.

Grotius will have this to be meant of the great difficulty of drawing the primitive Christians from their religion, and quotes it as used proverbially by Galen; when he would express a thing very difficult and morally impossible, he saith, “You may sooner draw away a Christian from Christ.”

    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     We must not be troubled, for two reasons.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (1.) Because we are bid to expect this: the Jews must be punished, ruin must be brought upon them; by this the justice of God and the honour of the Redeemer must be asserted; and therefore
     <i>
      all those things must come to pass
     </i>
     ; the word is gone out of God’s mouth, and it shall be accomplished in its season. Note, The consideration of the unchangeableness of the divine counsels, which govern all events, should compose and quiet our spirits, whatever happens. God is but performing the thing that is appointed for us, and our inordinate trouble is an interpretative quarrel with that appointment. Let us therefore acquiesce, because
     <i>
      these things must come to pass
     </i>
     ; not only
     <i>
      necessitate decreti—as the product of the divine counsel
     </i>
     , but
     <i>
      necessitate medii—as a means in order to a further end
     </i>
     . The old house must be taken down (though it cannot be done without noise, and dust, and danger), ere the new fabric can be erected: the things that are shaken (and ill shaken they were)
     <i>
      must be removed, that the things which cannot be shaken may remain
     </i>
     , Heb. 12:27.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (2.) Because we are still to expect worse;
     <i>
      The end is not yet
     </i>
     ; the end of time is not, and, while time lasts, we must expect trouble, and that the end of one affliction will be but the beginning of another; or, “The end of these troubles is not yet; there must be more judgments that one made use of to bring down the Jewish power; more vials of wrath must yet be poured out; there is but one woe past, more woes are yet to come, more arrows are yet to be spent upon them out of God’s quiver; therefore be not troubled, do not give way to fear and trouble, sink not under the present burthen, but rather gather in all the strength and spirit you have, to encounter what is yet before you. Be not troubled to hear of wars and rumours of wars; for then what will become of you when the famines and pestilences come?” If it be to us a vexation but to
     <i>
      understand the report
     </i>
     (Isa. 28:19), what will it be to feel the stroke when it
     <i>
      toucheth the bone and the flesh

     ? If running with the footmen weary us, how shall we contend with horses? And if we be frightened at a little brook in our way,

These were the three judgments which David was to choose one out of; and he was in a great strait, for he knew not which was the worst: but what dreadful desolations will they make, when they all pour in together upon a people!

The world was generally leavened with enmity and malignity to Christians: the Jews, though spiteful to the Heathen, were never persecuted by them as the Christians were; they were hated by the Jews that were dispersed among the nations, were the common butt of the world’s malice. What shall we think of this world, when the best men had the worst usage in it? It is the cause that makes the martyr, and comforts him; it was for Christ’s sake that they were thus hated; their professing and preaching his name incensed the nations so much against them; the devil, finding a fatal shock thereby given to his kingdom, and that his time was likely to be short,
     <i>

    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (1.) The
     <i>
      apostasy

     of some. When the profession of Christianity begins to cost men dear,
     <i>
      then shall many be offended
     </i>
     , shall first fall out with, and then fall off from, their profession; they will begin to pick quarrels with their religion, sit loose to it, grow weary of it, and at length revolt from it. Note, [1.] It is no new thing (though it is a strange thing) for those that have known the way of righteousness, to turn aside out of it. Paul often complains of deserters, who began well, but something hindered them. They were with us, but went out from us, because never truly of us, 1 John 2:19. We are told of it before. [2.] Suffering times are shaking times; and those fall in the storm, that stood in fair weather, like the
     <i>
      stony ground hearers
     </i>
     , Matt. 13:21. Many will follow Christ in the sunshine, who will shift for themselves, and leave him to do so to, in the cloudy dark day. They like their religion while they can have it cheap, and sleep with it in a whole skin; but, if their profession cost them any thing, they quit it presently.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (2.) The
     <i>
      malignity
     </i>
     of others. When persecution is in fashion, envy, enmity, and malice, are strangely diffused into the minds of men by contagion: and charity, tenderness, and moderation, are looked upon as singularities, which make a man like a speckled bird. Then
     <i>
      they shall betray one another
     </i>
     , that is,”Those that have treacherously deserted their religion, shall hate and betray those who adhere to it, for whom they have pretended friendship.” Apostates have commonly been the most bitter and violent persecutors. Note, Persecuting times are discovering times. Wolves in sheep’s clothing will then throw off their disguise, and appear wolves: they shall
     <i>
      betray one another, and hate one another
     </i>
     . The times must needs be perilous, when treachery and hatred, two of the worst things that can be, because directly contrary to two of the best (truth and love), shall have the ascendant. This seems to refer to the barbarous treatment which the several contending factions among the Jews gave to one another; and justly were they who ate up God’s people as they ate bread, left thus to bite and devour one another till they were
     <i>
      consumed one of another
     </i>
     ; or, it may refer to the mischiefs done to Christ’s disciples by those that were nearest to them, as Matt. 10:21.

     <i>

     in a special manner abound; as when it is more extensive than ordinary, as in the old world, when
     <i>

     ; and when it is more
     <i>

     <i>
      violence is risen up to a rod of wickedness

      left her first love
     </i>
     , Rev. 2:2-4. Or, it may be understood more particularly of brotherly love. When iniquity abounds, seducing iniquity, persecuting iniquity, this grace commonly waxes cold. Christians begin to be shy and suspicious one of another, affections are alienated, distances created, parties made, and so love comes to nothing. The devil is the accuser of the brethren, not only to their enemies, which makes persecuting iniquity abound, but one to another, which makes the love of many to wax cold.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     This gives a melancholy prospect of the times, that there shall be such a great decay of love; but,
     <i>
      First
     </i>
     , It is of the love of
     <i>
      many
     </i>
     , not of
     <i>
      all
     </i>
     . In the worst of times, God has his remnant that hold fast their integrity, and retain their zeal, as in Elijah’s days, when he thought himself left alone.
     <i>
      Secondly
     </i>
     , This love is grown cold, but not dead; it abates, but is not quite cast off. There is life in the root, which will show itself when the winter is past. The new nature may
     <i>
      wax cold
     </i>
     , but shall not
     <i>
      wax old
     </i>
     , for then it would decay and vanish away.

     3. Comfort administered in reference to this offence of the cross, for the support of the Lord’s people under it (Matt. 24:13);
     <i>
      He that endures to the end, shall be saved
     </i>
     . (1.) It is comfortable to those who wish well to the cause of Christ in general, that, though many are offended, yet some shall endure to the end. When we see so many drawing back, we are ready to fear that the cause of Christ will sink for want of supporters, and his name be left and forgotten for want of some to make profession of it; but even at this time there is
     <i>
      a remnant according to the election of grace
     </i>
     , Rom. 11:5. It is spoken of the same time that this prophecy has reference to; a remnant who are not of
     <i>
      them that draw back unto perdition
     </i>
     , but believe and persevere
     <i>
      to the saving of the soul
     </i>
     ; they endure to the end, to the end of their lives, to the end of their present state of probation, or to the end of these suffering trying times, to the last encounter, though they should be called to resist unto blood. (2.) It is comfortable to those who do thus endure to the end, and suffer for their constancy, that they shall be saved. Perseverance wins the crown, through free grace, and shall wear it.
     <i>
      They shall be saved
     </i>
     : perhaps they may be delivered out of their troubles, and comfortably survive them in this world; but it is eternal salvation that is here intended. They that endure to the end of their days, shall then receive the end of their faith and hope,
     <i>
      even the salvation of their souls

     V. He foretels the preaching of the gospel in all the world (Matt. 24:14);
     <i>
      This gospel shall be preached, and then shall the end come
     </i>
     . Observe here, 1. It is called
     <i>
      the gospel of the kingdom
     </i>
     , because it reveals the kingdom of grace, which leads to the kingdom of glory; sets up Christ’s kingdom in this world; and secures ours in the other world. 2. This gospel, sooner or later, is to be preached in all the world, to every creature, and all nations are to be discipled by it; for in it Christ is to be
     <i>
      Salvation to the ends of the earth
     </i>
     ; for this end the gift of tongues was
     <i>
      the first-fruits of the Spirit
     </i>
     . 3. The gospel is preached
     <i>
      for a witness to all nations
     </i>
     , that is, a faithful declaration of the mind and will of God concerning the duty which God requires from man, and the recompence which man may expect from God. It is a
     <i>
      record
     </i>
     (1 John 5:11), it is a
     <i>
      witness
     </i>
     , for those who believe, that they shall be saved, and against those who persist in unbelief, that they shall be damned. See Mark 16:16. But how does this come in here?

     (1.) It is intimated that the gospel should be, if not heard, yet at least heard of, throughout the then known world, before the destruction of Jerusalem; that the Old-Testament church should not be quite dissolved till the New Testament was pretty well settled, had got considerable footing, and began to make some figure. Better is the face of a corrupt degenerate church than none at all. Within forty years after Christ’s death, the
     <i>
      sound
     </i>
     of the gospel was
     <i>
      gone forth to the ends of the earth
     </i>
     , Rom. 10:18. St. Paul
     <i>
      fully preached the gospel from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum
     </i>
     ; and the other apostles were not idle. The persecuting of the saints at Jerusalem helped to disperse them, so that they
     <i>
      went every where, preaching the word
     </i>
     , Acts 8:1-4. And when the tidings of the Redeemer are sent over all parts of the world, then shall come the end of the Jewish state. Thus, that which they thought to prevent, by putting Christ to death, they thereby procured; all men
     <i>
      believed on him, and the Romans came, and took away their place and nation
     </i>
     , John 11:48. Paul speaks of the gospel being
     <i>
      come to all the world, and preached to every creature
     </i>
     , Col. 1:6-23.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (2.) It is likewise intimated that even in times of temptation, trouble, and persecution, the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached and propagated, and shall force its way through the greatest opposition. Though the enemies of the church grow very
     <i>
      hot
     </i>
     , and many of her friends very
     <i>
      cool
     </i>
     , yet the gospel shall be preached. And even
     <i>
      then
     </i>
     , when many fall by the sword and by flame, and many do wickedly, and are corrupted by flatteries, yet then the people that do know their God, shall be strengthened to do the greatest exploits of all, in instructing many; see

     (3.) That which seems chiefly intended here, is, that the end of the world shall be
     <i>
      then

     , and not till then, when the gospel has done its work in the world. The gospel shall be preached, and that work carried on, when you are dead; so that all nations, first or last, shall have either the enjoyment, or the refusal, of the gospel; and
     <i>
      then cometh the end
     </i>
     , when the kingdom
     <i>
      shall be delivered up to God, even the Father
     </i>
     ; when the mystery of God shall be finished, the mystical body completed, and the nations either converted and saved, or convicted and silenced, by the gospel;

     VI. He foretels more particularly the ruin that was coming upon the people of the Jews, their city, temple, and nation, Matt. 24:15 Here he comes more closely to answer their questions concerning the desolation of the temple; and what he said here, would be of use to his disciples, both for their conduct and for their comfort, in reference to that great event; he describes the several steps of that calamity, such as are usual in war.

     1. The Romans
     <i>
      setting up the abomination of desolation in the holy place
     </i>
     , Matt. 24:15. Now, (1.) Some understand by this an image, or statue, set up in the temple by some of the Roman governors, which was very offensive to the Jews, provoked them to rebel, and so brought the desolation upon them. The image of Jupiter Olympius, which Antiochus caused to be set upon the altar of God, is called
     <b>
      <i>
       Bdelygma eremoseos
      </i>
     </b>
     —
     <i>
      The abomination of desolation
     </i>
     , the very word here used by the historian, 1 Macc. 1:54. Since the captivity in Babylon, nothing was, nor could be, more distasteful to the Jews than an image in the holy place, as appeared by the mighty opposition they made when Caligula offered to set up his statue there, which had been of fatal consequence, if it had not been prevented, and the matter accommodated, by the conduct of Petronius; but Herod did set up an eagle over the temple-gate; and, some say, the statue of Titus was set up in the temple. (2.) Others choose to expound it by the parallel place (Luke 21:20),
     <i>
      when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies
     </i>
     . Jerusalem was the holy city, Canaan the holy land, the Mount Moriah, which lay about Jerusalem, for its nearness to the temple was, they thought in a particular manner holy ground; on the country lying round about Jerusalem the Roman army was encamped, that was the abomination that made desolate. The land of an enemy is said to be
     <i>
      the land which thou abhorrest
     </i>
     (Isa. 7:16); so an enemy’s army to a weak but wilful people may well be called
     <i>
      the abomination
     </i>
     . Now this is said to be
     <i>
      spoken of by Daniel, the prophet
     </i>
     , who spoke more plainly of the Messiah and his kingdom than any of the Old-Testament prophets did. He speaks of an abomination making desolate, which should be set up by Antiochus (
     <span class="bibleref" title="Dan.11.31">
      Dan. 11:31
     </span>
     ;
     <span class="bibleref" title="Dan.12.11">
      12:11
     </span>
     ); but this that our Saviour refers to, we have in the message that the angel brought him (Dan. 9:27), of what should come at the end of seventy weeks, long after the former;
     <i>
      for the overspreading of abominations
     </i>
     , or, as the margin reads it,
     <i>
      with the abominable armies
     </i>
     (which comes home to the prophecy here),
     <i>
      he shall make it desolate
     </i>
     . Armies of idolaters may well be called
     <i>
      abominable armies
     </i>
     ; and some think, the tumults, insurrections, and abominable factions and seditions, in the city and temple, may at least be taken in as part of the abomination making desolate. Christ refers them to that prophecy of Daniel, that they might see how the ruin of their city and temple was spoken of in the Old Testament, which would both confirm his prediction, and take off the odium of it. They might likewise from thence gather the time of it—soon after the cutting off of Messiah the prince; the sin that procured it—their rejecting him, and the certainty of it—
     <i>
      it is a desolation determined
     </i>
     . As Christ by his precepts confirmed the law, so by his predictions he confirmed the prophecies of the Old Testament, and it will be of good use to compare both together.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     Reference being here had to a prophecy, which is commonly dark and obscure, Christ inserts this memorandum, “
     <i>
      Whoso readeth, let him understand
     </i>
     ; whoso readeth the prophecy of Daniel, let him understand that it is to have its accomplishment now shortly in the desolations of Jerusalem.” Note, Those that read the scriptures, should labour to understand the scriptures, else their reading is to little purpose; we cannot use that which we do not understand. See
     <span class="bibleref" title="John.5.39">
      John 5:39
     </span>
     ;
     <span class="bibleref" title="Acts.8.30">
      Acts 8:30
     </span>
     . The angel that delivered this prophecy to Daniel, stirred him up to
     <i>
      know and understand
     </i>
     , Dan. 9:25. And we must not despair of understanding even dark prophecies; the great New-Testament prophecy is called a
     <i>
      revelation
     </i>
     , not a
     <i>
      secret
     </i>
     . Now
     <i>
      things revealed belong to us
     </i>
     , and therefore must be humbly and diligently searched into. Or,
     <i>
      Let him understand
     </i>
     , not only the scriptures which speak of those things, but by the scriptures let him
     <i>
      understand the times
     </i>
     , 1 Chron. 12:32. Let him observe, and take notice; so some read it; let him be assured, that, notwithstanding the vain hopes with which the deluded people feed themselves, the abominable armies will make desolate.

     2. The means of preservation which thinking men should betake themselves to (

     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Matt.24.20">

     );
     <i>
      Then let them which are in Judea, flee
     </i>
     . Then conclude there is no other way to help yourselves than by flying for the same. We may take this,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (1.) As a prediction of the ruin itself; that it should be irresistible; that it would be impossible for the stoutest hearts to make head against it, or contend with it, but they must have recourse to the last shift, getting out of the way. It bespeaks that which Jeremiah so much insisted upon, but in vain, when Jerusalem was besieged by the Chaldeans, that it would be to no purpose to resist, but that it was their wisdom to yield and capitulate; so Christ here, to show how fruitless it would be to stand it out, bids every one make the best of his way.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (2.) We may take it as a direction to the followers of Christ what to do, not to
     <i>
      say, A confederacy
     </i>
     with those who fought and warred against the Romans for the preservation of their city and nation, only that they might consume the wealth of both upon their lusts (for to this very affair, the struggles of the Jews against the Roman power, some years before their final overthrow, the apostle refers, Jas. 4:1-3); but let them acquiesce in the decree that was gone forth, and with all speed quit the city and country, as they would quit a falling house or a sinking ship, as Lot quitted Sodom, and Israel the tents of Dathan and Abiram; he shows them,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     [1.] Whither they must flee—from Judea
     <i>
      to the mountains
     </i>
     ; not the mountains round about Jerusalem, but those in the remote corners of the land, which would be some shelter to them, not so much by their strength as by their secrecy. Israel is said to be
     <i>
      scattered upon the mountains
     </i>
     (2 Chron. 18:16); and see Heb. 11:38. It would be safer among the lions’ dens, and the mountains of the leopards, than among the seditious Jews or the enraged Romans. Note, In times of imminent peril and danger, it is not only lawful, but our duty, to seek our own preservation by all good and honest means; and if God opens a door of escape, we ought to make our escape, otherwise we do not trust God but tempt him. There may be a time when even
     <i>
      those that are in Judea
     </i>
     , where God is known, and his name is great, must
     <i>
      flee to the mountains
     </i>
     ; and while we only go out of the way of danger, not out of the way of duty, we may trust God to provide
     <i>
      a dwelling for his outcasts
     </i>
     ,

     <i>

     </i>
     , when the alarm comes, let him not
     <i>
      come down into the house

     , to look after his effects there, but go the nearest way down, to make his escape; and so he that shall be
     <i>
      in the field
     </i>
     , will find it his wisest course to run immediately, and not return to fetch his clothes or the wealth of his house, for two reasons,
     <i>
      First
     </i>
     , Because the time which would be taken up in packing up his things, would delay his flight. Note, When death is at the door, delays are dangerous; it was the charge to Lot,
     <i>
      Look not behind thee
     </i>
     . Those that are convinced of the misery of a sinful state, and the ruin that attends them in that state, and, consequently, of the necessity of their fleeing to Christ, must take heed, lest, after all these convictions, they perish eternally by delays.
     <i>
      Secondly
     </i>
     , Because the carrying of his clothes, and his other movables and valuables with him, would but burthen him, and clog his flight. The Syrians, in their flight,
     <i>
      cast away their garments
     </i>
     , 2 Kgs. 7:15. At such a time, we must be thankful
     <i>
      if our lives be given us for a prey
     </i>
     , though we can save nothing,

      For the life is more than meat

     <i>
      Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator—The pennyless traveller can lose nothing by robbers
     </i>
     . It was to his own disciples that Christ recommended this forgetfulness of their house and clothes, who had a habitation in heaven, treasure there, and durable clothing, which the enemy could not plunder them of.
     <i>
      Omnia mea mecum porto—I have all my property with me
     </i>

     Now those to whom Christ said this immediately, did not live to see this dismal day, none of all the twelve but John only; they needed not to be hidden in the mountains (Christ hid them in heaven), but they left the direction to their successors in profession, who pursued it, and it was of use to them; for when the Christians in Jerusalem and Judea saw the ruin coming on, they all retired to a town called
     <i>
      Pella
     </i>
     , on the other side Jordan, where they were safe; so that of the many thousands that perished in the destruction of Jerusalem, there was not so much as one Christian. See

     , To them also the flight would be most afflictive,; the women with child cannot make haste, or go far; the sucking child cannot be left behind, or, if it should,
     <i>
      can a woman forget it, that she should not have compassion on it
     </i>
     ? If it be carried along, it retards the mother’s flight, and so exposes her life, and is in danger of Mephibosheth’s fate, who was lamed by a fall he got in his nurse’s flight. 2 Sam. 4:4.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     [4.] What they should pray against at that time—
     <i>
      that your flight be not in the winter, nor on the sabbath day
     </i>
     , Matt. 24:20. Observe, in general, it becomes Christ’s disciples, in times of public trouble and calamity, to be much in prayer; that is a salve for every sore, never out of season, but in a special manner seasonable when we are distressed on every side. There is no remedy but you must flee, the decree is gone forth, so that God will not be entreated to take away his wrath, no, not if
     <i>
      Noah, Daniel, and Job, stood before him. Let it suffice thee, speak no more of that matter
     </i>
     , but labour to make the best of that which is; and when you cannot in faith pray that you may not be forced to flee, yet pray that the circumstances of it may be graciously ordered, that, though the cup may not pass from you, yet the extremity of the judgment may be prevented. Note, God has the disposing of the circumstances of events, which sometimes make a great alteration one way or other; and therefore in those our eyes must be ever toward him. Christ’s bidding them pray for this favour, intimates his purpose of granting it to them; and in a general calamity we must not overlook a circumstantial kindness, but see and own wherein it might have been worse. Christ still bids his disciples to pray for themselves and their friends, that, whenever they were forced to flee, it might be in the most convenient time. Note, When trouble is in prospect, at a great distance, it is good to lay in a stock of prayers beforehand; they must pray,
     <i>
      First, That their flight
     </i>
     , if it were the will of God,
     <i>
      might not be in the winter
     </i>
     , when the days are short, the weather cold, the ways dirty, and therefore travelling very uncomfortable, especially for whole families. Paul hastens Timothy to come to him before winter, 2 Tim. 4:21. Note, Though the ease of the body is not to be
     <i>
      mainly
     </i>
     consulted, it ought to be
     <i>
      duly
     </i>
     considered; though we must take what God sends, and when he sends it, yet we may pray against bodily inconveniences, and are encouraged to do so, in that
     <i>
      the Lord is for the body. Secondly
     </i>
     , That it might not be
     <i>
      on the sabbath day
     </i>
     ; not on the Jewish sabbath, because travelling then would give offence to them who were angry with the disciples for plucking the ears of corn on the day; not on the Christian sabbath, because being forced to travel on the day would be a grief to themselves. This intimates Christ’s design, that a weekly sabbath should be observed in his church after the preaching of the gospel to all the world. We read not of any of the ordinances of the Jewish church, which were purely ceremonial, that Christ ever expressed any care about, because they were all to vanish; but for the sabbath he often showed a concern. It intimates likewise that the sabbath is ordinarily to be observed as a day of rest from travel and worldly labour; but that, according to his own explication of the fourth commandment, works of necessity were lawful on the sabbath day, as this of fleeing from an enemy to save our lives: had it not been lawful, he would have said, “Whatever becomes of you, do not flee on the sabbath day, but abide by it, though you die by it.” For we must not commit the least sin, to escape the greatest trouble. But it intimates, likewise, that it is very uneasy and uncomfortable to a good man, to be taken off by any work of necessity from the solemn service and worship of God on the sabbath day. We should pray that we may have quiet undisturbed sabbaths, and may have no other work than sabbath work to do on sabbath days; that we may attend upon the Lord without distraction. It was desirable, that, if they must flee, they might have the benefit and comfort of one sabbath more to help to bear their charges. To flee in the winter is uncomfortable to the body; but to flee on the sabbath day is so to the soul, and the more so when it remembers former sabbaths, as Ps. 42:4.

    <p class="tab-1">
     3. The greatness of the troubles which should immediately ensue (Matt. 24:21);
     <i>
      Then shall be great tribulation
     </i>
     ; then when the measure of iniquity is full; then when the servants of God are sealed and secured, then come the troubles; nothing can be done against Sodom till Lot is entered into Zoar, and then look for fire and brimstone immediately.
     <i>
      There shall be great tribulation
     </i>
     . Great, indeed, when within the city plague and famine raged, and (worse than either) faction and division, so that every man’s sword was against his fellow; then and there it was that the hands of the pitiful women flayed their own children. Without the city was the Roman army ready to swallow them up, with a particular rage against them, not only as Jews, but as rebellious Jews. War was the only one of the three sore judgments that David excepted against; but that was it by which the Jews were ruined; and there were famine and pestilence in extremity besides. Josephus’s
     <i>
      History of the Wars of the Jews
     </i>
     , has in it more tragical passages than perhaps any history whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (1.) It was a desolation unparalleled, such as
     <i>
      was not since the beginning of the world, nor ever shall be
     </i>
     . Many a city and kingdom has been made desolate, but never any with a desolation like this. Let not daring sinners think that God has done his worst, he can heat the furnace seven times and yet seven times hotter, and will, when he sees greater and still greater abominations. The Romans, when they destroyed Jerusalem, were degenerated from the honour and virtue of their ancestors, which had made even their victories easy to the vanquished. And the wilfulness and obstinacy of the Jews themselves contributed much to the increase of the tribulation. No wonder that the ruin of Jerusalem was an unparalleled ruin, when the sin of Jerusalem was an unparalleled sin—even their crucifying Christ. The nearer any people are to God in profession and privileges, the greater and heavier will his judgments be upon them, if they abuse those privileges, and be false to that profession, Amos 3:2.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (2.) It was a desolation which, if it should continue long, would be intolerable, so that
     <i>
      no flesh should be saved
     </i>
     , Matt. 24:22. So triumphantly would death ride, in so many dismal shapes, and with such attendants, that there would be no escaping, but, first or last, all would be cut off. He that escaped one sword, would fall by another,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Isa.24.17">
      Isa. 24:17
     </span>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Isa.24.18">
      18
     </span>
     . The computation which Josephus makes of those that were slain in several places, amounts to above two millions.
     <i>
      No flesh shall be saved
     </i>
     ; he doth not say, “No
     <i>
      soul
     </i>
     shall be saved,” for the destruction of the flesh may be for
     <i>
      the saving of the spirit in the day of the Lord Jesus
     </i>
     ; but temporal lives will be sacrificed so profusely, that one would think, if it last awhile, it would make a full end.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     But here is one word of comfort in the midst of all this terror—that
     <i>
      for the elects’ sake these days shall be shortened
     </i>
     , not made shorter than what God had determined (for
     <i>
      that which is determined, shall be poured upon the desolate
     </i>
     , Dan. 9:27), but shorter than what he might have decreed, if he had dealt with them according to their sins; shorter than what the enemy designed, who would have cut all off, if God who made use of them to serve his own purpose, had not set bounds to their wrath; shorter than one who judged by human probabilities would have imagined. Note, [1.] In times of common calamity God manifests his favour to the elect remnant; his jewels, which he will then make up; his peculiar treasure, which he will secure when the lumber is abandoned to the spoiler. [2.] The shortening of calamities is a kindness God often grants for the elects’ sake. Instead of complaining that our afflictions last so long, if we consider our defects, we shall see reason to be thankful that they do not last always; when it is bad with us, it becomes us to say, “Blessed be God that it is no worse; blessed be God that it is not hell, endless and remediless misery.” It was a lamenting church that said,
     <i>
      It is of the Lord’s mercies that we are not consumed
     </i>
     ; and it is for the sake of the elect, lest their spirit should fail before them, if he should contend for ever, and lest they should be tempted to put forth, if not their heart, yet their hand, to iniquity.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     And now comes in the repeated caution, which was opened before, to take heed of being ensnared by false Christs, and false prophets; (Matt. 24:23), who would promise them deliverance, as the lying prophets in Jeremiah’s time (
     <span class="bibleref" title="Jer.14.13">

     We have here the practical application of the foregoing prediction; in general, we must expect and prepare for the events here foretold.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     I. We must expect them; “
     <i>
      Now learn a parable of the fig-tree
     </i>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Matt.24.32">

     . Now learn what use to make of the things you have heard; so observe and understand the signs of the times, and compare them with the predictions of the word, as from thence to foresee what is at the door, that you may provide accordingly.” The parable of the fig-tree is no more than this, that its budding and blossoming are a presage of summer; for as the
     <i>
      stork
     </i>
     in the heaven, so the trees of the field,
     <i>
      know their appointed time
     </i>
     . The beginning of the working of second causes assures us of the progress and perfection of it. Thus when God begins to fulfil prophecies, he will make an end. There is a certain series in the works of providence, as there is in the works of nature. The signs of the times are compared with the prognostics of
     <i>
      the face of the sky
     </i>
     (Matt. 16:3), so here with those of
     <i>
      the face of the earth
     </i>
     ; when that is renewed, we foresee that summer is coming, not immediately, but at some distance; after
     <i>
      the branch grows tender
     </i>
     , we expect the March winds, and the April showers, before the summer comes; however, we are sure it is coming; “so likewise ye, when the gospel day shall dawn, count upon it, that through this variety of events which I have told you of, the perfect day will come.
     <i>
      The things revealed must shortly come to pass
     </i>
     (Rev. 1:1); they must come in their own order, in the order appointed for them.
     <i>
      Know that it is near
     </i>
     .” He does not here say what, but it is that which the hearts of his disciples are upon, and which they are inquisitive after, and long for;
     <i>
      the kingdom of God is near
     </i>
     , so it is expressed in the parallel place, Luke 21:31. Note, When the trees of righteousness begin to bud and blossom, when God’s people promise faithfulness, it is a happy presage of good times. In them God begins his work, first prepares their heart, and then he will go on with it; for,
     <i>
      as for God, his work is perfect
     </i>
     ; and he will
     <i>
      revive it in the midst of their years
     </i>
     .

    <p class="tab-1">
     Now touching the events foretold here, which we are to expect,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     1. Christ here assures us of the certainty of them (Matt. 24:35);
     <i>
      Heaven and earth shall pass away
     </i>
     ; they continue this day indeed, according to God’s ordinance, but they shall not continue for ever (
     <span class="bibleref" title="Ps.102.25">
      Ps. 102:25
     </span>
     ,

     ;

     </span>
     );
     <i>
      but my words shall not pass away
     </i>
     . Note, The word of Christ is more sure and lasting than heaven and earth.
     <i>
      Hath he spoken? And shall he not do it
     </i>
     ? We may build with more assurance upon the word of Christ than we can upon the pillars of heaven, or the strong foundations of the earth; for, when they shall be made to tremble and totter, and shall be no more, the word of Christ shall remain, and be in full force, power, and virtue. See
     <span class="bibleref" title="1Pet.1.24">
      1 Pet. 1:24
     </span>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="1Pet.1.25">

     </span>
     .
     <i>
      It is easier for heaven and earth to pass
     </i>
     , than the word of Christ; so it is expressed, Luke 16:17. Compare Isa. 54:10. The accomplishment of these prophecies might seem to be delayed, and intervening events might seem to disagree with them, but do not think that therefore the word of Christ is fallen to the ground, for that shall never pass away: though it be not fulfilled, either in the time or in the way that we have prescribed; yet, in God’s time, which is the best time, and in God’s way, which is the best way, it shall certainly be fulfilled. Every word of Christ is very pure, and therefore very sure.

    <p class="tab-1">
     (1.) As to
     <i>
      these things
     </i>
     , the wars, seductions, and persecutions, here foretold, and especially the ruin of the Jewish nation; “
     <i>
      This generation shall not pass away, till all these things be fulfilled
     </i>
     (Matt. 24:34); there are those now alive, that shall see Jerusalem destroyed, and the Jewish church brought to an end.” Because it might seem strange, he backs it with a solemn asseveration; “
     <i>
      Verily, I say unto you
     </i>
     . You may take my word for it, these things are at the door.” Christ often speaks of the nearness of that desolation, the more to affect people, and quicken them to prepare for it. Note, There may be greater trials and troubles yet before us, in our own day, than we are aware of. They that are old, know not what sons of Anak may be reserved for their last encounters.

To this end we must expect these events, that we may prepare for them; and here we have a caution against security and sensuality, which will make it a dismal day indeed to us, Matt. 24:37-41.

     <i>
      For judgment I am come

     <i>
      Licitus perimus omnes—These lawful things undo us

     , unlawfully managed.
     <i>
      First
     </i>
     , They were unreasonable in it, inordinate and entire in the pursuit of the delights of sense, and the gains of the world; they were wholly taken up with these things,

      </i>
     </b>
     —
     <i>
      they were eating
     </i>
     ; they were in these things as in their element, as if they had their being for no other end than
     <i>
      to eat and drink
     </i>
     , Isa. 56:12.
     <i>
      Secondly
     </i>
     , They were unreasonable in it; they were entire and intent upon the world and the flesh, when the destruction was at the door, which they had had such fair warning of. They were eating and drinking, when they should have been repenting and praying; when God, by the ministry of Noah, called to
     <i>
      weeping and mourning, then joy and gladness
     </i>
     . This was to them, as it was to Israel afterwards, the unpardonable sin (
     <span class="bibleref" title="Isa.22.12">
      Isa. 22:12
     </span>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Isa.22.14">
      14
     </span>
     ), especially, because it was in defiance of those warnings by which they should have been awakened. “
     <i>
      Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die
     </i>
     ; if it must be a short life, let it be a merry one.” The apostle James speaks of this as the general practice of the wealthy Jews before the destruction of Jerusalem; when they should have been
     <i>
      weeping for the miseries that were coming upon them, they were living in pleasure, and nourishing their hearts as in a day of slaughter
     </i>
     ,

     [2.] They were secure and careless;
     <i>
      they knew not, until the flood came
     </i>
     , Matt. 24:39.
     <i>
      Knew not
     </i>
     ! Surely they could not but know. Did not God, by Noah, give them fair warning of it? Did he not call them to repentance, while his long-suffering waited?
     <span class="bibleref" title="1Pet.3.19">
      1 Pet. 3:19

     </span>
     . But they knew not, that is, they believed not; they might have known, but would not know. Note, What we know of
     <i>
      the things that belong to our everlasting peace
     </i>
     , if we do not mix faith with it, and improve it, is all one as if we did not know it at all. Their
     <i>
      not knowing
     </i>
     is joined with their
     <i>
      eating, and drinking, and marrying
     </i>
     ; for,
     <i>
      First, Therefore
     </i>
     they were sensual, because they were secure. Note, the reason why people are so eager in the pursuit, and so entangled in the pleasures of this world, is, because they do not know, and believe, and consider, the eternity which they are upon the brink of. Did we know aright that all these things must shortly be dissolved, and we must certainly survive them, we should not set our eyes and hearts so much upon them as we do.
     <i>
      Secondly, Therefore
     </i>
     they were secure, because they were sensual;
     <i>
      therefore
     </i>
     they knew not that the flood was coming, because they were eating and drinking; were so taken up with things seen and present, that they had neither time nor heart to mind the things not seen as yet, which they were warned of. Note, As security bolsters men up in their brutal sensuality; so sensuality rocks them asleep in their carnal security.
     <i>
      The knew not, until the flood came
     </i>
     . 1. The flood did come, though they would not foresee it. Note, Those that will not know by faith, shall be made to know by feeling,
     <i>
      the wrath of God revealed from heaven against their ungodliness and unrighteousness
     </i>
     . The evil day is never the further off for men’s putting it far off from them. 2. They did not know it till it was too late to prevent it, as they might have done if they had known it in time, which made it so much the more grievous. Judgments are most terrible and amazing to the secure, and those that have made a jest of them.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     The application of this, concerning the old world, we have in these words;
     <i>
      So shall the coming of the Son of man be
     </i>
     ; that is, (1.) In such a posture shall he find people, eating and drinking, and not expecting him. Note, Security and sensuality are likely to be the epidemical diseases of the latter days. All
     <i>
      slumber and sleep, and at midnight the bridegroom comes
     </i>
     . All are off their watch, and at their ease. (2.) With such a power, and for such a purpose, will he come upon them. As the flood took away the sinners of the old world, irresistibly and irrecoverably; so shall secure sinners, that mocked at Christ and his coming, be taken away by
     <i>
      the wrath of the Lamb, when the great day of his wrath comes
     </i>
     , which will be like the coming of the deluge, a destruction which there is no fleeing from.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     2. It will be a separating day (
     <span class="bibleref" title="Matt.24.40">
      Matt. 24:40
     </span>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Matt.24.41">
      41
     </span>
     );
     <i>
      Then shall two be in the field
     </i>
     . Two ways this may be applied.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (1.) We may apply it to the success of the gospel, especially at the first preaching of it; it divided the world;
     <i>
      some believed the things which were spoken
     </i>
     , and were taken to Christ;
     <i>
      others believed not
     </i>
     , and were left to perish in their unbelief. Those of the same age, place, capacity, employment, and condition, in the world,
     <i>
      grinding in the same mill
     </i>
     , those of the same family, nay, those that were joined in the same bond of marriage, were, one effectually called, the other passed by, and left in the gall of bitterness. This is that division, that separating fire, which Christ
     <i>
      came to send
     </i>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Luke.12.49">
      Luke 12:49
     </span>

     <span class="bibleref" title="Luke.12.51">
      51
     </span>
     .
     <i>
      This
     </i>
     renders free grace the more obliging, that it is distinguishing;
     <i>
      to us, and not to the world
     </i>
     (John 14:22), nay to us, and not to those in the same field, the same mill, the same house.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     When ruin came upon Jerusalem, a distinction was made by Divine Providence, according to that which had been before made by divine grace; for all the Christians among them were saved from perishing in that calamity, by the special care of Heaven. If two were at work in the field together, and one of them was a Christian, he was taken into a place of shelter, and had his life given him for a prey, while the other was left to the sword of the enemy. Nay, if but two women were grinding at the mill, if one of them belonged to Christ, though but a woman, a poor woman, a servant, she was taken to a place of safety, and the other abandoned. Thus
     <i>
      the meek of the earth are hid in the day of the Lord’s anger
     </i>
     (Zeph. 2:3), either in heaven, or
     <i>
      under
     </i>
     heaven. Note, Distinguishing preservations, in times of general destruction, are special tokens of God’s favour, and ought so to be acknowledged. If we are safe when thousands fall on our right hand and our left, are not consumed when others are consumed round about us, so that we are as brands plucked out of the fire, we have reason to say,
     <i>
      It is of the Lord’s mercies
     </i>
     , and it is a great mercy.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (2.) We may apply it to the second coming of Jesus Christ, and the separation which will be made in that day. He had said before (Matt. 24:31), that the elect will be
     <i>
      gathered together
     </i>
     . Here he tells us, that, in order to that, they will be distinguished from those who were nearest to them in this world; the choice and chosen ones taken to glory, the other left to perish eternally. Those who sleep in the dust of the earth, two in the same grave, their ashed mixed, shall yet arise, one to be taken to everlasting life, the other left
     <i>
      to shame and everlasting contempt
     </i>
     , Dan. 12:2. Here it is applied to them who shall be found alive. Christ will come unlooked for, will find people busy at their usual occupations,
     <i>
      in the field, at the mill
     </i>
     ; and then, according as they are vessels of mercy prepared for glory, or vessels of wrath prepared for ruin, accordingly it will be with them; the one taken
     <i>
      to meet the Lord and his angels in the air, to be for ever with him and them
     </i>
     ; the other left to the devil and his angels, who, when Christ has gathered out his own, will sweep up the residue. This will aggravate the condemnation of sinners that others shall be taken from the midst of them to glory, and they left behind. And it speaks abundance of comfort to the Lord’s people. [1.] Are they mean and despised in the world, as the man-servant in the field, or the maid at the mill (Exod. 11:5)? Yet they shall not be forgotten or overlooked in that day. The poor in the world, if rich in faith, are
     <i>
      heirs of the kingdom
     </i>
     . [2.] Are they dispersed in distant and unlikely places, where one would not expect to find the heirs of glory,
     <i>
      in the field, at the mill
     </i>
     ? Yet the angels will find them there (hidden as Saul among the stuff, when they are to be enthroned), and fetch them thence; and well may they be said to be
     <i>
      changed
     </i>
     , for a very great change it will be to go to heaven from ploughing and grinding. [3.] Are they weak, and unable of themselves to move heavenward? They shall be taken, or
     <i>
      laid hold of
     </i>
     , as Lot was taken out of Sodom by a gracious violence, Gen. 19:16. Those whom Christ has once apprehended and laid hold on, he will never lose his hold of. [4.] Are they intermixed with others, linked with them in the same habitations, societies, employments? Let not that discourage any true Christian; God knows how to separate between the precious and the vile, the gold and dross in the same lump, the wheat and chaff in the same floor.

     III. Here is a general exhortation to us,
     <i>
      to watch, and be ready
     </i>
     against that day comes, enforced by divers weighty considerations, Matt. 24:42 Observe,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     1. The duty required;
     <i>
      Watch, and be ready

     ,

      Matt. 24:42
     </span>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Matt.24.44">

     </span>
     .
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (1.)
     <i>
      Watch therefore
     </i>
     , Matt. 24:42. Note, It is the great duty and interest of all the disciples of Christ to watch, to be awake and keep awake, that they may mind their business. As a sinful state or way is compared to
     <i>
      sleep
     </i>
     , senseless and inactive (1 Thess. 5:6), so a gracious state or way is compared to
     <i>
      watching
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      waking
     </i>
     . We must watch for our Lord’s coming, to us in particular at our death,
     <i>
      after which is the judgment
     </i>
     , that is
     <i>
      the great day
     </i>
     with us, the end of our time; and his coming at the end of all time to judge the world, the
     <i>
      great day
     </i>
     with all mankind. To watch implies not only to believe that our Lord will come, but to desire that he would come, to be often thinking of his coming, and always looking for it as sure and near, and the time of it uncertain. To watch for Christ’s coming, is to maintain that gracious temper and disposition of mind which we should be willing that our Lord, when he comes, should find us in. To watch is to be aware of the first notices of his approach, that we may immediately attend his motions, and address ourselves to the duty of meeting him. Watching is supposed to be in the night, which is sleeping time; while we are in this world, it is
     <i>
      night
     </i>
     with us, and we must take pains to keep ourselves awake.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (2.)
     <i>
      Be ye also ready
     </i>
     . We wake in vain, if we do not get ready. It is not enough to
     <i>
      look
     </i>
     for such things; but we must therefore
     <i>
      give diligence
     </i>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="2Pet.3.11">
      2 Pet. 3:11
     </span>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="2Pet.3.14">
      14
     </span>
     . We have then our Lord to attend upon, and we must have our lamps ready trimmed; a cause to be tried, and we must have our plea ready drawn and signed by our Advocate; a reckoning to make up, and we must have our accounts ready stated and balanced; there is an inheritance which we then hope to enter upon, and we must have ourselves ready, made meet to partake of it, Col. 1:12.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     2. The reasons to induce us to this watchfulness and diligent preparation for that day; which are two.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (1.) Because the time of our Lord’s coming is very uncertain. This is the reason immediately annexed to the double exhortation (
     <span class="bibleref" title="Matt.24.42">
      Matt. 24:42
     </span>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Matt.24.44">
      44
     </span>
     ); and it is illustrated by a comparison, Matt. 24:43. Let us consider then,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     [1.] That
     <i>
      we know not what hour he will come
     </i>
     , Matt. 24:42. We know not
     <i>
      the day of our death
     </i>
     , Gen. 27:2. We may know that we have but
     <i>
      a little time to live (The time of my departure is at hand
     </i>
     , 2 Tim. 4:6); but we cannot know that we have a long time to live, for our souls are continually in our hands; nor can we know how little a time we have to live, for it may prove less than we expect; much less do we know the time fixed for the general judgment. Concerning both we are kept at uncertainty, that we may, every day, expect that which may come any day; may never boast of a year’s continuance (Jas. 4:13), no, nor of tomorrow’s return, as if it were ours,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Prov.27.1">
      Prov. 27:1
     </span>
     ;
     <span class="bibleref" title="Luke.12.20">
      Luke 12:20
     </span>
     .
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     [2.] That he may
     <i>
      come at such an hour as we think not
     </i>
     , Matt. 24:44. Though there be such uncertainty in the time, there is none in the thing itself: though we know not
     <i>
      when
     </i>
     he will come, we are sure he
     <i>
      will
     </i>
     come. His parting word was,
     <i>
      Surely I come quickly
     </i>
     ; his saying, “I come
     <i>
      surely
     </i>
     ,” obliges us to expect him: his saying “I come
     <i>
      quickly
     </i>
     .” obliges us to be always expecting him; for it keeps us in a state of expectancy.
     <i>
      In such an hour as you think not
     </i>
     , that is, such an hour as they who are unready and unprepared, think not (Matt. 24:50); nay, such an hour as the most lively expectants perhaps thought least likely. The bridegroom came when the wise were slumbering. It is agreeable to our present state, that we should be under the influence of a constant and general expectation, rather than that of particular presages and prognostications, which we are sometimes tempted vainly to desire and wish for.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     [3.] That the children of this world are thus wise in their generation, that, when they know of a danger approaching, they will keep awake, and stand on their guard against it. This he shows in a particular instance, Matt. 24:43. If the master of a house had notice that a thief would come such a night, and such a watch of the night (for they divided the night into four watches, allowing three hours to each), and would make an attempt upon his house, though it were the midnight-watch, when he was most sleepy, yet he would be up, and listen to every noise in every corner, and be ready to give him a warm reception. Now, though we know not
     <i>
      just when
     </i>
     our Lord will come, yet, knowing that he
     <i>
      will
     </i>
     come, and come quickly, and without any other warning than what he hath given in his word, it concerns us to watch always. Note,
     <i>
      First
     </i>
     , We have every one of us a house to keep, which lies exposed, in which all we are worth is laid up: that house is our own souls, which we must
     <i>
      keep with all diligence. Secondly
     </i>
     , The day of the Lord comes
     <i>
      by surprise, as a thief in the night
     </i>
     . Christ chooses to come when he is least expected, that the triumphs of his enemies may be turned into the greater shame, and the fears of his friends into the greater joy.
     <i>
      Thirdly
     </i>
     , If Christ, when he comes, finds us asleep and unready, our house will be broken up, and we shall lose all we are worth, not as by a thief unjustly, but as by a just and legal process; death and judgment will seize upon all we have, to our irreparable damage and utter undoing. Therefore be ready,
     <i>
      be ye also ready
     </i>
     ; as ready at all times as the good man of the house would be at the hour when he expected the thief: we must put on the armour of God, that we may not only stand in that evil day, but, as more than conquerors, may divide the spoil.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (2.) Because the issue of our Lord’s coming will be very happy and comfortable to those that shall be found ready, but very dismal and dreadful to those that shall not, Matt. 24:45 This is represented by the different state of good and bad servants, when their lord comes to reckon with them. It is likely to be well or ill with us to eternity, according as we are found ready or unready at that day; for Christ comes
     <i>
      to render to every man according to his works
     </i>
     . Now this parable, with which the chapter closes, is applicable to all Christians, who are in profession and obligation God’s servants; but it seems especially intended as a warning to ministers; for the servant spoken of is a
     <i>
      steward
     </i>
     . Now observe what Christ here saith,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     [1.] Concerning the
     <i>
      good servant
     </i>
     ; he shows here what he is—
     <i>
      a ruler of the household
     </i>
     ; what, being so, he should be—
     <i>
      faithful
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      wise
     </i>
     ; and what, if he be so, he shall be eternally-
     <i>
      blessed
     </i>
     . Here are good instructions and encouragements to the ministers of Christ.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     <i>
      First
     </i>
     , We have here his place and office. He is one
     <i>
      whom the Lord has made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season
     </i>
     . Note, 1. The church of Christ is his household, or family, standing in relation to him as the Father and Master of it. It is
     <i>
      the household of God
     </i>
     , a family named from Christ, Eph. 3:15. 2. Gospel ministers are appointed
     <i>
      rulers
     </i>
     in this household; not at princes (Christ has entered a caveat against that), but as stewards, or other subordinate officers; not as lords, but as guides; not to prescribe new ways, but to show and lead in the ways that Christ has appointed: that is the signification of the
     <b>
      <i>
       hegoumenoi
      </i>
     </b>
     , which we translate,
     <i>
      having rule over you
     </i>
     (Heb. 13:17); as
     <i>
      overseers
     </i>
     , not to cut out new work, but to direct in, and quicken to, the work which Christ has ordered; that is the signification of
     <b>
      <i>
       episkopoi
      </i>
     </b>
     —
     <i>
      bishops
     </i>
     . They are rulers by Christ; what power they have is derived from him, and none may take it from them, or abridge it to them; he is one whom
     <i>
      the Lord has made ruler
     </i>
     ; Christ has the
     <i>
      making
     </i>
     of ministers. They are rulers
     <i>
      under
     </i>
     Christ, and act in subordination to him; and rulers
     <i>
      for
     </i>
     Christ, for the advancement of his kingdom. 3. The work of gospel ministers is to give to Christ’s household their meat in due season, as stewards, and therefore they have the keys delivered to them. (1.) Their work is
     <i>
      to give
     </i>
     , not take to themselves (Ezek. 34:8), but give to the family what the Master has bought, to
     <i>
      dispense
     </i>
     what Christ has

     <i>
      meat
     </i>
     ; not to give
     <i>
      law
     </i>
     (that is Christ’s work), but to deliver those doctrines to the church which, if duly digested, will be nourishment to souls. They must give, not the poison of false doctrines, not the stones of hard and unprofitable doctrines, but the meat that is
     <i>
      sound
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      wholesome
     </i>
     . (3.) It must be given

     , His right discharge of this office. The good servant, if thus preferred, will be a good
     <i>
      steward
     </i>
     ; for,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     1. He is
     <i>
      faithful
     </i>
     ; stewards must be so, 1 Cor. 4:2. He that is
     <i>
      trusted
     </i>
     , must be trusty; and the greater the trust is, the more is expected from them. It is a great good thing that is committed to
     <i>
      ministers
     </i>
     (2 Tim. 1:14); and they must be faithful, as Moses was, Heb. 3:2. Christ counts those ministers, and those only, that are
     <i>
      faithful
     </i>
     , 1 Tim. 1:12. A faithful minister of Jesus Christ is one that sincerely designs his master’s honour, not his own; delivers
     <i>
      the whole counsel of God
     </i>
     , not his own fancies and conceits; follows Christ’s institutions and adheres to them; regards the meanest, reproves the greatest, and doth not respect persons.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     2. He is wise to understand his duty and the proper season of it; and in guiding of the flock there is need, not only of the integrity of the heart, but the skilfulness of the hands. Honesty may suffice for a good
     <i>
      servant
     </i>
     , but wisdom is necessary to a
     <i>
      good steward
     </i>
     ; for it is profitable to direct.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     3. He is doing;
     <i>
      so doing
     </i>
     as his office requires. The ministry is a good work, and they whose office it is, have always something to do; they must not indulge themselves in ease, nor leave the work undone, or carelessly turn it off to others, but be doing, and doing to the purpose—
     <i>
      so doing
     </i>
     , giving meat to the household, minding their own business, and not meddling with that which is foreign;
     <i>
      so doing
     </i>
     as the Master has appointed, as the office imports, and as the case of the family requires; not
     <i>
      talking
     </i>
     , but
     <i>
      doing
     </i>
     . It was the motto Mr. Perkins used,
     <i>
      Minister verbi es—You are a minister of the word
     </i>
     . Not only
     <i>
      Age—Be doing
     </i>
     ; but
     <i>
      Hoc age—Be so doing
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     4. He is
     <i>
      found doing
     </i>
     when his Master comes; which intimates, (1.) Constancy at his work. At what hour soever his Master comes, he is found busy at the work of the day. Ministers should not leave empty spaces in their time, lest their Lord should come in one of those empty spaces. As with a good God the end of one mercy is the beginning of another, so with a good man, a good minister, the end of one duty is the beginning of another. When Calvin was persuaded to remit his ministerial labours, he answered, with some resentment, “What, would you have my Master find me idle?” (2.) Perseverance in his work till the Lord come.

      Thirdly
     </i>
     , The recompence of reward intended him for this, in three things.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     1. He shall be taken notice of. This is intimated in these words, Who then is that
     <i>
      faithful and wise servant
     </i>
     ? Which supposes that there are but few who answer this character; such an interpreter is
     <i>
      one of a thousand
     </i>
     , such a faithful and wise
     <i>
      steward
     </i>
     . Those who thus distinguish themselves now by humility, diligence, and sincerity in their work, Christ will in the great day both dignify and distinguish by the glory conferred on them.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     2. He shall be blessed?
     <i>
      Blessed is that servant
     </i>
     ; and Christ’s pronouncing him blessed makes him so. All the dead that die n the Lord are blessed, Rev. 14:13. But there is a peculiar blessedness secured to them that approve themselves faithful stewards, and are found so doing. Next to the honour of those who die in the field of battle, suffering for Christ as the martyrs, is the honour of those that die in the field of service, ploughing, and sowing, and reaping, for Christ.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     3. He shall be preferred (Matt. 24:47);
     <i>
      He shall make him ruler over all his goods
     </i>
     . The allusion is to the way of great men, who, if the stewards of their house conduct themselves well in that place, commonly prefer them to be the managers of their estates; thus Joseph was preferred in the house of Potiphar,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Gen.29.4">
      Gen. 29:4
     </span>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Gen.29.6">
      6
     </span>
     . But the greatest honour which the kindest master ever did to his most tried servants in this world, is nothing to that weight of glory which the Lord Jesus will confer upon his faithful watchful servants in the world to come. What is here said by a similitude, is the same that is said more plainly, John 11:26;
     <i>
      Him will my Father honour
     </i>
     . And God’s servants, when thus preferred; shall be perfect in wisdom and holiness to bear that weight of glory, so that there is no danger from these servants when they reign.

     </span>
     ); where we have the wretch drawn in his own colours. The vilest of creatures is a wicked man, the vilest of men is a wicked Christian, and the vilest of them a wicked minister.
     <i>
      Corruptio optimi est pessima—What is best, when corrupted, becomes the worst
     </i>
     . Wickedness in the prophets of Jerusalem is a
     <i>
      horrible
     </i>
     thing indeed, Jer. 23:14. Here is,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     1. The cause of his wickedness; and that is, a practical disbelief of Christ’s second coming; He hath
     <i>
      said in his heart, My Lord delays his coming
     </i>
     ; and therefore he begins to think he will never come, but has quite forsaken his church. Observe, (1.) Christ knows that
     <i>
      they
     </i>
     say in their hearts, who with their lips cry,
     <i>
      Lord, Lord
     </i>
     , as this servant here. (2.) The delay of Christ’s coming, though it is a gracious instance of his patience, is greatly abused by wicked people, whose hearts are thereby hardened in their wicked ways. When Christ’s coming is looked upon as doubtful, or a thing at an immense distance, the hearts of
     <i>
      men are fully set to do evil
     </i>
     , Eccl. 8:11. See Ezek. 12:27. They that walk by sense, are ready to say of the unseen Jesus, as the people did of Moses when he tarried in the mount upon their errand,
     <i>
      We wot not what is become of him
     </i>
     , and therefore
     <i>
      up, make us gods
     </i>
     , the world a god, the belly a god, any thing but him that should be.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     2. The particulars of his wickedness; and they are sins of the first magnitude; he is a slave to his passions and his appetites.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (1.) Persecution is here charged upon him. He begins to
     <i>
      smite his fellow servants
     </i>
     . Note, [1.] Even the stewards of the house are to look upon all the servants of the house as their fellow servants, and therefore are forbidden to
     <i>
      lord it over them
     </i>
     . If the angel call himself
     <i>
      fellow servant
     </i>
     to John (Rev. 19:10), no marvel if John have learned to call himself
     <i>
      brother
     </i>
     to the Christians of the churches of Asia, Rev. 1:9. [2.] It is no new thing to see evil servants smiting their fellow servants; both private Christians and faithful ministers. He smites them, either because they reprove him, or because they will not bow, and do him reverence; will not say as he saith, and do as he doeth, against their consciences: he smites them with the tongue, as they smote the prophet, Jer. 18:18. And if he get power into his hand, or can press those into his service that have, as the ten horns upon the head of the beast, it goes further. Pashur the priest smote Jeremiah, and put him in the stocks, Jer. 20:2. The revolters have often been of all others most
     <i>
      profound to make slaughter
     </i>
     , Hos. 5:2. The steward, when he smites his fellow servants, does it under colour of his Master’s authority, and in his name; he says,
     <i>
      Let the Lord be glorified
     </i>
     (Isa. 66:5); but he shall know that he could not put a greater affront upon his Master.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (2.) Profaneness and immorality;
     <i>
      He begins to eat and drink with the drunken
     </i>
     . [1.] He associates with the worst of sinners, has fellowship with them, is intimate with them; he walks in their counsel, stands in their way, sits in their seat, and sings their songs. The drunken are the merry and jovial company, and those he is for, and thus he hardens them in their wickedness. [2.] He does like them;
     <i>
      eats, and drinks, and is drunken
     </i>
     ; so it is in Luke. This is an inlet to all manner of sin. Drunkenness is a leading wickedness; they who are slaves to that, are never masters of themselves in any thing else. The persecutors of God’s people have commonly been the most vicious and immoral men. Persecuting consciences, whatever the pretensions be, are commonly the most profligate and debauched consciences. What will not
     <i>
      they
     </i>
     be drunk with, that will be
     <i>
      drunk with the blood of the saints
     </i>
     ? Well, this is the description of a wicked minister, who yet may have the common gifts of learning and utterance above others; and, as hath been said of some, may preach so well in the pulpit, that it is a pity he should ever come out, and yet live so ill out of the pulpit, that it is a pity he should ever come in.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     <i>
      Secondly
     </i>
     , His doom read,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Matt.24.50">
      Matt. 24:50
     </span>
     ,
     <span class="bibleref" title="Matt.24.51">
      51
     </span>
     . The coat and character of wicked ministers will not only not secure them from condemnation, but will greatly aggravate it. They can plead no exemption from Christ’s jurisdiction, whatever they pretend to, in the church of Rome, from that of the civil magistrate; there is no benefit of clergy at Christ’s bar. Observe,
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     1. The surprise that will accompany his doom (Matt. 24:50);
     <i>
      The Lord of that servant will come
     </i>
     . Note, (1.) Our putting off the thoughts of Christ’s coming will not put off his coming. Whatever fancy he deludes himself with, his Lord will come. The unbelief of man shall not make that great promise, or threatening (call it which you will), of no effect. (2.) The coming of Christ will be a most dreadful surprise to secure and careless sinners, especially to wicked ministers;
     <i>
      He shall come in a day when he looketh not for him
     </i>
     . Note, Those that have slighted the warnings of the word, and silenced those of their own consciences concerning the judgment to come, cannot expect any other warnings; these will be adjudged sufficient legal notice given, whether taken or no; and no unfairness can be charged on Christ, if he come suddenly, without giving other notice. Behold, he has told us before.
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     2. The severity of his doom, Matt. 24:51. It is not more severe than righteous, but it is a doom that carries in it utter ruin, wrapt up in two dreadful words,
     <i>
      death
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      damnation
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p class="tab-1">
     (1.) Death. His Lord shall
     <i>
      cut him asunder
     </i>
     ,
     <b>
      <i>
       dikotomesei auton
      </i>
     </b>
     , “he shall cut him off from the land of the living,” from the congregation of the righteous, shall separate him unto evil; which is the definition of a
     <i>
      curse
     </i>
     (Deut. 29:21), shall cut him down, as a tree that cumbers the ground; perhaps it alludes to the sentence often used in the law,
     <i>
      That soul shall be cut off from his people
     </i>
     ; denoting an utter extirpation. Death cuts off a good man, as a choice imp is cut off to be grafted in a better stock; but it cuts off a wicked man, as a withered branch is cut off for the fire-cuts him off from this world, which he set his heart so much upon, and was, as it were, one with. Or, as we read it,
     <i>
      shall cut him asunder
     </i>
     , that is, part body and soul, send the body to the grave to be a prey for worms, and the soul to hell to be a prey for devils, and there is the sinner cut asunder. The soul and body of a godly man at death part fairly, the one cheerfully lifted up to God, the other left to the dust; but the soul and body of a wicked man at death are cut asunder, torn asunder, for to them death is the
     <i>
      king of terrors
     </i>
     , Job 18:14. The wicked servant divided himself between God and the world, Christ and Belial, his profession and his lusts, justly therefore will he thus be divided.
