  This second epistle Paul wrote to Timothy from Rome, when he was a prisoner there and in danger of his life; this is evident from these words,
  <i>
   I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand
  </i>
  , 2 Tim. 4:6. It appears that his removal out of this world, in his own apprehension, was not far off, especially considering the rage and malice of his persecutors; and that he had been brought before the emperor Nero, which he calls
  <i>
   his first answer, when no man stood with him, but all men forsook him
  </i>
  , 2 Tim. 4:16. And interpreters agree that this was the last epistle he wrote. Where Timothy now was is not certain. The scope of this epistle somewhat differs from that of the former, not so much relating to his office as an evangelist as to his personal conduct and behaviour.
