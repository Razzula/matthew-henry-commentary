  The penman of this epistle appears plainly to be the same who wrote the foregoing; and, whatever difference some learned men apprehend they discern in the style of this epistle from that of the former, this cannot be a sufficient argument to assert that it was written by Simon who succeeded the apostle James in the church at Jerusalem, inasmuch as he who wrote this epistle calls himself
  <i>
   Simon Peter, and an apostle
  </i>
  (2 Pet. 1:1), and says that he was
  <i>
   one of the three apostles that were present at Christ’s transfiguration
  </i>
  (2 Pet. 1:18), and says expressly
  <i>
   that he had written a former epistle to them
  </i>
  , 2 Pet. 3:1. The design of this second epistle is the same with that of the former, as is evident from the 2 Pet. 3:1; whence observe that, in the things of God, we have need of
  <i>
   precept upon precept, and line upon line
  </i>
  , and all little enough to keep them in remembrance; and yet these are the things which should be most faithfully recorded and frequently remembered by us.
