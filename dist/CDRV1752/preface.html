    The Apocryphal texts (known to Catholics as the Deuterocanonical texts) from the
    Challoner Douay-Rheims Version of the Bible, a specific revision made by Bishop
    Richard Challoner between 1749 and 1752 of the original Douay-Rheims Bible,
    which was translated by scholars at the English College in Douay and Rheims
    (including Gregory Martin, Richard Bristow, and Thomas Worthington) and published
    in 1582 (New Testament) and 1609-1610 (Old Testament) as an English translation
    of the Latin Vulgate Bible.
